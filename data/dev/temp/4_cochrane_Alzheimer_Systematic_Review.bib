abstract = {Abstract - Background Souvenaid is a dietary supplement with a patented composition (Fortasyn Connect™)which is intended to be used by people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been designed to support the formation and function of synapses in the brain, which are thought to be strongly correlated with cognitive function. If effective, it might improve symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and also prevent the progression from prodromal Alzheimer's disease to dementia. We sought in this review to examine the evidence for this proposition. Objectives To assess the effects of Souvenaid on incidence of dementia, cognition, functional performance, and safety in people with Alzheimer's disease. Search methods We searched ALOIS, i.e. the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), Web of Science (ISI Web of Science), Cinahl (EBSCOhost), Lilacs (BIREME), and clinical trials registries up to 24 June 2020. We also reviewed citations of reference lists of landmark papers, reviews, and included studies for additional studies and assessed their suitability for inclusion in the review. Selection criteria We included randomised, placebo‐controlled trials which evaluated Souvenaid in people diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (also termed prodromal AD) or with dementia due to AD, and with a treatment duration of at least 16 weeks. Data collection and analysis Our primary outcome measures were incidence of dementia, global and specific cognitive function, functional performance, combined cognitive‐functional outcomes and adverse events. We selected studies, extracted data, assessed the quality of trials and intended to conduct meta‐analyses according to the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We present all outcomes grouped by stage of AD. Main results We included three randomised, placebo‐controlled trials investigating Souvenaid in 1097 community‐dwelling participants with Alzheimer's disease. One study each included participants with prodromal AD, mild AD dementia and mild‐to‐moderate AD dementia. We rated the risks of bias of all trials as low. One study (in prodromal AD) was funded by European grants. The other two studies were funded by the manufacturer of Souvenaid. One trial investigated the incidence of dementia in people with prodromal AD at baseline, and found little to no difference between the Souvenaid group and the placebo group after 24 months (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.43; 1 trial, 311 participants; moderate quality of evidence). In prodromal AD, and in mild and mild‐to‐moderate Alzheimer's disease dementia, Souvenaid probably results in little or no difference in global or specific cognitive functions (moderate quality of evidence). Everyday function, or the ability to perform activities of daily living, were measured in mild and mild‐to‐moderate AD dementia. Neither study found evidence of a difference between the groups after 24 weeks of treatment (moderate quality of evidence). Two studies investigated combined cognitive‐functional outcomes with the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes and observed conflicting results. Souvenaid probably results in slight improvement, which is below estimates of meaningful change, in participants with prodromal Alzheimer's disease after 24 months (moderate quality of evidence), but probably has little to no effect in mild‐to‐moderate Alzheimer's disease dementia after 24 weeks (moderate quality of evidence). Adverse effects observed were low in all trials, and the available data were insufficient to determine any connection with Souvenaid. Authors' conclusions Two years of treatment with Souvenaid probably does not reduce the risk of progression to dementia in people with prodromal AD. There is no convincing evidence that Souvenaid affects other outcomes important to people with AD in the prodromal stage or mild‐to‐moderate stages of dementia. Conflicting evidence on combined cognitive‐functional outcomes in prodromal AD and mild AD dementia warrants further investigation. Adverse effects of Souvenaid seem to be uncommon, but the evidence synthesised in this review does not permit us to make a definitive statement on the long‐term tolerability of Souvenaid. The effects of Souvenaid in more severe AD dementia or in people with AD at risk of nutritional deficiencies remain unclear. Plain language summary The dietary supplement Souvenaid for preventing dementia or delaying cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer's disease Review question We investigated whether people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) can reduce their risk of developing dementia with a patented dietary supplement called Souvenaid. We also investigated the effect of Souvenaid on memory or other thinking skills, ability to carry out daily activities, and side effects in people with MCI or any stage of dementia due to AD. Background Alzheimer's disease is a brain disease. It is the commonest cause of dementia among older people. A person is said to have dementia when there has been a decline in their memory and thinking skills which is severe enough to stop them being fully independent in all their daily activities. Because AD develops slowly, it is also possible to pick up symptoms before dementia is fully developed. This pre‐dementia stage, when people with AD have a detectable decline in memory and thinking skills but are still able to manage their usual activities independently, is known as mild cognitive impairment due to AD, or 'prodromal' AD. Souvenaid is a patented mix of vitamins and minerals (Fortasyn Connect™) which was designed to improve brain function in AD. It is a drink which is to be taken once a day. It is intended to be consumed under medical supervision, in addition to the usual diet. Search for evidence We systematically searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which were published up to June 2020 and which compared treatment with Souvenaid for at least 16 weeks with treatment with a dummy supplement (a placebo). For the comparison to be fair, it had to be decided randomly whether each participant was given Souvenaid or the placebo. Key results We found three RCTs with a total of 1097 participants to include in the review. Two of the trials investigated Souvenaid in people with dementia over a treatment period of 24 weeks. One of these included 527 participants with mild‐to‐moderate dementia due to AD and the other included 259 participants with mild dementia due to AD. The third trial investigated the use of Souvenaid for two years in 311 people with prodromal AD. We considered all of the trials to be well‐designed, but because of differences between them in the severity of the participants' symptoms and in the way the researchers measured their results, we were not able to combine the data numerically from the single trials. All the results we report are therefore based on single trials, which leads us to have only moderate confidence in the findings of this review. This means that results could be changed by further research. We found that people with prodromal AD who took Souvenaid daily for two years were probably no more or less likely than those taking placebo to develop dementia. Souvenaid probably had little or no effect on measures of memory or other thinking skills in people with prodromal AD (after two years of treatment) or with mild or mild‐to‐moderate dementia due to AD (after 24 weeks of treatment). It also probably had little or no effect on the ability of people with mild or mild‐to‐moderate dementia due to AD to manage everyday activities (again after 24 weeks). Two studies used an outcome scale which combined memory and thinking skills with practical skills (described as a combined cognitive‐functional outcome). There was probably a small benefit of Souvenaid on this outcome among people with prodromal AD who took Souvenaid for two years. However, there was probably little or no effect of Souvenaid on this outcome among people with mild‐to‐moderate AD dementia who took it for 24 weeks. There were only a few adverse events reported in the trials, and it was not possible to know whether any of them were side effects of Souvenaid. Study funding sources Two studies were funded by the manufacturer of Souvenaid. The third study (in prodromal AD) was funded by European grants.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Despite the high prevalence of apathy in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and its harmful effects, there are currently no therapies proven to treat this symptom. Recently, a number of pharmacological therapies have been investigated as potential treatments for apathy in AD. Objectives Objective 1: To assess the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapies for the treatment of apathy in Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Objective 2: To assess the effect on apathy of pharmacotherapies investigated for other primary outcomes in the treatment of AD. Search methods We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) portal, ICTRP on 17 May 2017. Selection criteria Eligible studies were double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled trials (RCTs) investigating apathy as a primary or secondary outcome in people with AD. Data collection and analysis Three review authors extracted data. We assessed the risks of bias of included studies using Cochrane methods, and the overall quality of evidence for each outcome using GRADE methods. We calculated mean difference (MD), standardized mean difference (SMD) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals on an intention‐to‐treat basis for all relevant outcome measures. Main results We included 21 studies involving a total of 6384 participants in the quantitative analyses. Risk of bias is very low to moderate. All studies reported appropriate methods of randomization and blinding. Most studies reported appropriate methods of allocation concealment. Four studies, three with methylphenidate and one with modafinil, had a primary aim of improving apathy. In these studies, all participants had clinically significant apathy at baseline. Methylphenidate may improve apathy compared to placebo. This finding was present when apathy was assessed using the apathy evaluation scale (AES), which was used by all three studies investigating methylphenidate: MD ‐4.99, 95% CI ‐9.55 to ‐0.43, n = 145, 3 studies, low quality of evidence, but not when assessed with the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI)‐apathy subscale, which was used by two of the three studies investigating methylphenidate: MD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐3.85 to 3.69, n = 85, 2 studies, low quality of evidence. As well as having potential benefits for apathy, methylphenidate probably also slightly improves cognition (MD 1.98, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.91, n = 145, 3 studies, moderate quality of evidence), and probably improves instrumental activities of daily living (MD 2.30, 95% CI 0.74 to 3.86, P = 0.004, n = 60, 1 study, moderate quality of evidence), compared to placebo. There may be no difference between methylphenidate and placebo in the risk of developing an adverse event: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.42, n = 145, 3 studies, low quality of evidence. There was insufficient evidence from one very small study of modafinil to determine the effect of modafinil on apathy assessed with the FrSBe‐apathy subscale: MD 0.27, 95% CI ‐3.51 to 4.05, n = 22, 1 study, low quality of evidence. In all other included studies, apathy was a secondary outcome and participants were not selected on the basis of clinically significant apathy at baseline. We considered the evidence on apathy from these studies to be indirect and associated with publication bias. There was low or very low quality of evidence on cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) (six studies), ChEI discontinuation (one study), antipsychotics (two studies), antipsychotic discontinuation (one study), antidepressants (two studies), mibampator (one study), valproate (three studies) and semagacestat (one study). Authors' conclusions Methylphenidate may demonstrate a benefit for apathy and may have slight benefits for cognition and functional performance in people with AD, but this finding is associated with low‐quality evidence. Our meta‐analysis is limited by the small number of studies within each drug class, risk of bias, publication bias, imprecision and inconsistency between studies. Additional studies should be encouraged targeting people with AD with clinically significant apathy which investigate apathy as a primary outcome measure, and which have a longer duration and a larger sample size. This could increase the quality of evidence for methylphenidate, and may confirm whether or not it is an effective pharmacotherapy for apathy in AD. Plain language summary Drug treatments for apathy in Alzheimer's disease Review question We wanted to know whether there are any medications that are safe and effective for reducing apathy in people with Alzheimer's disease. Background Apathy is a state of reduced interest, lack of initiative and reduced activity. It is a very common symptom of Alzheimer's disease. It is often persistent and it is known to be linked to a lower quality of life, faster decline and more burden on caregivers. Effective treatments of apathy could improve the quality of life for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. What we did We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to May 2017 which had compared any medicine with a placebo (dummy pill) and measured the effect on apathy in people with Alzheimer's disease. We were only interested in trials in which it was decided randomly whether the people taking part got the drug of interest or the placebo; this was to make sure that the comparison was as fair as possible. What we found We found 21 RCTs involving more than 6300 people with Alzheimer’s disease. Four trials of two different medicines (methylphenidate and modafinil) had been done specifically to study apathy, so all the people taking part were known to be significantly apathetic before the trial started. The other 17 trials had other primary aims, but reported some data on apathy. The trials were generally well designed and conducted. From the three trials with methylphenidate, we found that it may improve apathy, although this depended on how the apathy was measured. The people taking methylphenidate also did slightly better than those taking placebo on scales measuring cognition (thinking, remembering, etc.) and some daily activities, but it was not clear that these effects were big enough to be important in practice. We found no evidence that it caused more side effects than placebo. The quality of this evidence was low or moderate, so we cannot be certain that other similar studies would not have different results. There was only one very small trial with modafinil and there was no evidence that it was effective for apathy. The other 17 trials studied a variety of medicines and included people who were not necessarily significantly apathetic to start with. We therefore thought they were only indirectly relevant to our review question. It is also highly likely that other trials of the same drugs have measured apathy but have not published the results, so we were concerned about possible publication bias (that the studies we found could have been a biased subset). We therefore thought the quality of evidence for all these other medicines was low or very low, meaning that we can have limited or little confidence in the results. Conclusions Current evidence suggests that methylphenidate may be useful for treating apathy in Alzheimer's disease. However, more trials should be done specifically targeting apathy in order to improve the overall quality of the evidence.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in older people. One approach to symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in the brain by blocking the action of the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This can be done by a group of drugs known as cholinesterase inhibitors. Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor. This review is an updated version of a review first published in 1998. Objectives To assess the clinical efficacy and safety of donepezil in people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease; to compare the efficacy and safety of different doses of donepezil; and to assess the effect of donepezil on healthcare resource use and costs. Search methods We searched Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement’s Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and a number of other sources on 20 May 2017 to ensure that the search was as comprehensive and up‐to‐date as possible. In addition, we contacted members of the Donepezil Study Group and Eisai Inc. Selection criteria We included all double‐blind, randomised controlled trials in which treatment with donepezil was administered to people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease for 12 weeks or more and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients, or where two different doses of donepezil were compared. Data collection and analysis One reviewer (JSB) extracted data on cognitive function, activities of daily living, behavioural symptoms, global clinical state, quality of life, adverse events, deaths and healthcare resource costs. Where appropriate and possible, we estimated pooled treatment effects. We used GRADE methods to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. Main results Thirty studies involving 8257 participants met the inclusion criteria of the review, of which 28 studies reported results in sufficient detail for the meta‐analyses. Most studies were of six months' duration or less. Only one small trial lasted 52 weeks. The studies tested mainly donepezil capsules at a dose of 5 mg/day or 10 mg/day. Two studies tested a slow‐release oral formulation that delivered 23 mg/day. Participants in 21 studies had mild to moderate disease, in five studies moderate to severe, and in four severe disease. Seventeen studies were industry funded or sponsored, four studies were funded independently of industry and for nine studies there was no information on source of funding. Our main analysis compared the safety and efficacy of donepezil 10 mg/day with placebo at 24 to 26 weeks of treatment. Thirteen studies contributed data from 3396 participants to this analysis. Eleven of these studies were multicentre studies. Seven studies recruited patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, two with moderate to severe, and four with severe Alzheimer's disease, with a mean age of about 75 years. Almost all evidence was of moderate quality, downgraded due to study limitations. After 26 weeks of treatment, donepezil compared with placebo was associated with better outcomes for cognitive function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale‐Cognitive (ADAS‐Cog, range 0 to 70) (mean difference (MD) ‐2.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.31 to ‐2.02, 1130 participants, 5 studies), the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (MD 1.05, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.37, 1757 participants, 7 studies) and the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB, range 0 to 100) (MD 5.92, 95% CI 4.53 to 7.31, 1348 participants, 5 studies). Donepezil was also associated with better function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study activities of daily living score for severe Alzheimer's disease (ADCS‐ADL‐sev) (MD 1.03, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.85, 733 participants, 3 studies). A higher proportion of participants treated with donepezil experienced improvement on the clinician‐rated global impression of change scale (odds ratio (OR) 1.92, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.39, 1674 participants, 6 studies). There was no difference between donepezil and placebo for behavioural symptoms measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (MD ‐1.62, 95% CI ‐3.43 to 0.19, 1035 participants, 4 studies) or by the Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE‐AD) scale (MD 0.4, 95% CI ‐1.28 to 2.08, 194 participants, 1 study). There was also no difference between donepezil and placebo for Quality of Life (QoL) (MD ‐2.79, 95% CI ‐8.15 to 2.56, 815 participants, 2 studies). Participants receiving donepezil were more likely to withdraw from the studies before the end of treatment (24% versus 20%, OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.50, 2846 participants, 12 studies) or to experience an adverse event during the studies (72% vs 65%, OR 1.59, 95% 1.31 to 1.95, 2500 participants, 10 studies). There was no evidence of a difference between donepezil and placebo for patient total healthcare resource utilisation. Three studies compared donepezil 10 mg/day to donepezil 5 mg/day over 26 weeks. The 5 mg dose was associated with slightly worse cognitive function on the ADAS‐Cog, but not on the MMSE or SIB, with slightly better QoL and with fewer adverse events and withdrawals from treatment. Two studies compared donepezil 10 mg/day to donepezil 23 mg/day. There were no differences on efficacy outcomes, but fewer participants on 10 mg/day experienced adverse events or withdrew from treatment. Authors' conclusions There is moderate‐quality evidence that people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease treated for periods of 12 or 24 weeks with donepezil experience small benefits in cognitive function, activities of daily living and clinician‐rated global clinical state. There is some evidence that use of donepezil is neither more nor less expensive compared with placebo when assessing total healthcare resource costs. Benefits on 23 mg/day were no greater than on 10 mg/day, and benefits on the 10 mg/day dose were marginally larger than on the 5 mg/day dose, but the rates of withdrawal and of adverse events before end of treatment were higher the higher the dose. Plain language summary Donepezil for people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease Review question What effects (benefits or harms) does donepezil have on people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease? Background Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. As the disease progresses, people lose the ability to remember, communicate, think clearly and perform the activities of daily living. Their behaviour may also change. In severe Alzheimer's disease people lose the ability to care for themselves. The most commonly used treatment for Alzheimer's disease are medicines known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Donepezil is one of these medicines. It is taken as a pill once a day. In Alzheimer's disease, one of the changes in the brain is a reduced number of nerve cells called cholinergic neurones. These are nerve cells that signal to other cells using a chemical called acetylcholine. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, work by preventing acetylcholine from being broken down. This may improve the symptoms of dementia. However, acetylcholine is also found elsewhere in the body and so drugs of this type may have unwanted effects. Review methods In this review we examined evidence about benefits and harms from studies that compared donepezil, taken for at least 12 weeks, to placebo (a dummy pill), or that compared different doses of donepezil. The studies had to be double‐blind and randomised, that is, the decision whether people taking part got donepezil or placebo had to be made randomly and neither they nor the researchers should have known which treatment they were getting while the trial was going on. This was to make the comparison as unbiased, or fair, as possible. We searched for studies up to May 2017. We assessed the quality of all the studies we included. When it was sensible to do so, we analysed the results of studies together to get an overall result. Key results We included 30 studies with 8257 participants. Most of the people in the studies had mild or moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, but in nine studies they had moderate or severe dementia. Almost all of the studies lasted six months or less. The majority of the studies were known to have been funded by the manufacturer of donepezil. We found that people with Alzheimer's disease who took 10 mg of donepezil a day for six months did slightly better than people taking placebo, on scales measuring their cognitive function (e.g. thinking and remembering), how well they could manage their daily activities, and the overall impression of a trained researcher. We did not find any effect on behaviour or quality of life. People taking donepezil were more likely than those taking placebo to report side effects and to drop out of the studies. Most side effects were described as mild. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were most common. Comparing 5 mg of donepezil a day with 10 mg/day, people on 5 mg had fewer side effects, but did slightly less well on cognitive function tests. A higher dose (23 mg/day) offered no advantages and was associated with more side effects. There is some evidence that use of donepezil is neither more nor less expensive than placebo when total health care costs are taken into account. Quality of the evidence In general, we thought that the quality of the evidence was moderate. The main factor reducing our confidence was concern that the results of some studies might have been biased by the way they were done. We cannot be sure that the results apply to treatment longer than six months. Conclusions After six months of treatment, there are benefits of donepezil that are large enough to measure in studies. It is associated with side effects that are mainly mild, but that may cause people to stop treatment. Being able to stabilise cognitive performance or ability to maintain activities of daily living may be important clinically. In terms of total healthcare costs the use of donepezil appears cost neutral. However, there does not appear to be an effect on quality of life. More data are still required from longer‐term clinical studies examining measures of disease progression or time to needing full time care.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Any type of seizure can be observed in Alzheimer's disease. Antiepileptic drugs seem to prevent the recurrence of epileptic seizures in most people with Alzheimer's disease. There are pharmacological and non‐pharmacological treatments for epilepsy in people with Alzheimer's disease, however there are no current systematic reviews to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of these treatments. This review aims to investigate these different modalities. This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review previously published in 2018. Objectives To assess the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological or non‐pharmacological interventions for the treatment of epilepsy in people with Alzheimer's disease (including sporadic Alzheimer's disease and dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease). Search methods For the latest update, on 3 August 2020 we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 31 July 2020). CRS Web includes randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials from PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Specialized Registers of Cochrane Review Groups, including Cochrane Epilepsy. In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials, we searched ongoing trials registers, reference lists and relevant conference proceedings; we also contacted trial authors and pharmaceutical companies. Selection criteria We included randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials investigating treatment for epilepsy in people with Alzheimer's disease, with the primary outcomes of proportion of participants with seizure freedom and proportion of participants experiencing adverse events. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, cross‐checked the data for accuracy and assessed the methodological quality. We performed no meta‐analyses due to there being limited available data. Main results We included one randomized controlled trial (RCT) on pharmacological interventions; the trial included 95 participants. No studies were found for non‐pharmacological interventions. Concerning the proportion of participants with seizure freedom, no significant differences were found for the comparisons of levetiracetam versus lamotrigine (RR) 1.20, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.71; 67 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), levetiracetam versus phenobarbital (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.19; 66 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), or lamotrigine versus phenobarbital (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.02; 57 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). It seemed that levetiracetam could improve cognition and lamotrigine could relieve depression, while phenobarbital and lamotrigine could worsen cognition, and levetiracetam and phenobarbital could worsen mood. The risk of bias relating to allocation, blinding and selective reporting was unclear. We judged the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes to be very low. Authors' conclusions This review does not provide sufficient evidence to support levetiracetam, phenobarbital or lamotrigine for the treatment of epilepsy in people with Alzheimer's disease. Regarding efficacy and tolerability, no significant differences were found between levetiracetam, phenobarbital and lamotrigine. Large RCTs with a double‐blind, parallel‐group design are required to determine the efficacy and tolerability of treatment for epilepsy in people with Alzheimer's disease. Plain language summary Treatment of epilepsy for people with Alzheimer's disease Background Alzheimer's disease is a risk factor for increased seizures in older people. Seizures of any type can be observed in Alzheimer's disease and are probably underestimated. Study characteristics We searched scientific databases for clinical trials comparing medication and non‐medication‐based treatments for epilepsy in people with Alzheimer's disease. We wanted to evaluate how well the treatment worked and if it had any side effects. Key results We included and analyzed one randomized controlled trial (a clinical study where people are randomly put into one or two (or more) treatment groups) with 95 participants. Concerning the proportion of participants with freedom from seizures, no significant differences were found between the antiepileptic drugs (levetiracetam versus lamotrigine, levetiracetam versus phenobarbital, and lamotrigine versus phenobarbital). It seemed that levetiracetam could improve cognition (thinking) and lamotrigine could relieve depression, while phenobarbital and lamotrigine could worsen cognition, and levetiracetam and phenobarbital could worsen mood. Certainty of the evidence The certainty of the evidence for all the outcomes from the study were very low. This means that we are very uncertain about the results and they should be interpreted with caution. Large randomized controlled trials are required to determine how effective and well tolerated treatments are for epilepsy in people with Alzheimer's disease.

abstract = {Abstract - Background Vitamin E occurs naturally in the diet. It has several biological activities, including functioning as an antioxidant to scavenge toxic free radicals. Evidence that free radicals may contribute to the pathological processes behind cognitive impairment has led to interest in the use of vitamin E supplements to treat mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2000, and previously updated in 2006 and 2012. Objectives To assess the efficacy of vitamin E in the treatment of MCI and dementia due to AD. Search methods We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS as well as many trials databases and grey literature sources on 22 April 2016 using the terms: "Vitamin E", vitamin‐E, alpha‐tocopherol. Selection criteria We included all double‐blind, randomised trials in which treatment with any dose of vitamin E was compared with placebo in people with AD or MCI. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures according to the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Where appropriate we attempted to contact authors to obtain missing information. Main results Four trials met the inclusion criteria, but we could only extract outcome data in accordance with our protocol from two trials, one in an AD population (n = 304) and one in an MCI population (n = 516). Both trials had an overall low to unclear risk of bias. It was not possible to pool data across studies owing to a lack of comparable outcome measures. In people with AD, we found no evidence of any clinically important effect of vitamin E on cognition, measured with change from baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale ‐ Cognitive subscale (ADAS‐Cog) over six to 48 months (mean difference (MD) ‐1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.75 to 0.13, P = 0.07, 1 study, n = 272; moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between vitamin E and placebo groups in the risk of experiencing at least one serious adverse event over six to 48 months (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05, P = 0.13, 1 study, n = 304; moderate quality evidence), or in the risk of death (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.34, P = 0.46, 1 study, n = 304; moderate quality evidence). People with AD receiving vitamin E showed less functional decline on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living Inventory than people receiving placebo at six to 48 months (mean difference (MD) 3.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 6.23, P = 0.04, 1 study, n = 280; moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence of any clinically important effect on neuropsychiatric symptoms measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (MD ‐1.47, 95% CI ‐4.26 to 1.32, P = 0.30, 1 study, n = 280; moderate quality evidence). We found no evidence that vitamin E affected the probability of progression from MCI to probable dementia due to AD over 36 months (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.35, P = 0.81, 1 study, n = 516; moderate quality evidence). Five deaths occurred in each of the vitamin E and placebo groups over the 36 months (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.44, P = 0.99, 1 study, n = 516; moderate quality evidence). We were unable to extract data in accordance with the review protocol for other outcomes. However, the study authors found no evidence that vitamin E differed from placebo in its effect on cognitive function, global severity or activities of daily living . There was also no evidence of a difference between groups in the more commonly reported adverse events. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence that the alpha‐tocopherol form of vitamin E given to people with MCI prevents progression to dementia, or that it improves cognitive function in people with MCI or dementia due to AD. However, there is moderate quality evidence from a single study that it may slow functional decline in AD. Vitamin E was not associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events or mortality in the trials in this review. These conclusions have changed since the previous update, however they are still based on small numbers of trials and participants and further research is quite likely to affect the results. Plain language summary The use of vitamin E in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD) Background Vitamin E is found in a variety of foods, including vegetable oils and fats, nuts and seeds. Some animal and non‐interventional studies have suggested it might have a role in the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, evidence has linked vitamin E with potentially serious side effects and even an increased risk of death. In this review, we looked for evidence about the effect of vitamin E on people who had either dementia due to AD or milder problems with memory or thinking (mild cognitive impairment or MCI). People with MCI have an increased risk of developing dementia. Included trials We searched for clinical trials published up to April 2016 which had randomly allocated people with dementia due to AD or with MCI to treatment with vitamin E supplements or a placebo (pretend treatment). We found three trials that investigated the effects of vitamin E on people with AD, but we could extract data from only one of these trials (304 participants). We found only one trial with 516 participants which investigated the effects of vitamin E on people with MCI. The quality of these two trials was generally good. Results Vitamin E did not reduce the number of people with MCI who developed dementia over three years. We also found no evidence that vitamin E improved cognition (e.g. learning and memory) in people with MCI or with dementia due to AD. One trial found that people with dementia due to AD who took vitamin E could manage daily activities (e.g. bathing and dressing) better than people who took placebo. There was no evidence from these trials that vitamin E caused significant harm to participants, but these types of trials are not the best way to look for harmful effects unless the effects are very common. Because all the results came from single trials, it is likely that further research could lead to different conclusions. Conclusion From limited evidence, we found nothing to suggest that there are either benefits or harms from vitamin E supplements. As the quality of evidence was only moderate, further trials are needed to confirm the findings. It is possible that different types or doses of vitamin E might have different effects.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Typical and atypical antipsychotics are widely used to treat agitation and psychosis in dementia. However, whether or not they are beneficial is uncertain. Some trials have yielded negative results and effectiveness may be outweighed by harms. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of antipsychotics for the treatment of agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid Sp), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's meta‐register, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal on 7 January 2021. Two review authors independently screened the title and abstract of the hits, and two review authors assessed the full text of studies that got through this screening. Selection criteria We included randomised, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐arm trials comparing the effects of antipsychotics and placebo for the treatment of agitation or psychosis in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, or both, irrespective of age, severity of cognitive impairment, and setting. (The majority of) participants had to have clinically significant agitation (including aggression) or psychosis or both at baseline. We excluded studies about antipsychotics that are no longer available in the USA or EU, or that are used for emergency short‐term sedation. We also excluded head‐to‐head trials and antipsychotic withdrawal trials. Data collection and analysis The primary outcomes were (1) reduction in agitation or psychosis in participants with agitation or psychosis, respectively at baseline, and (2) the number of participants with adverse events: somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms, any adverse event, any serious adverse event (SAE), and death. Two review authors independently extracted the necessary data and assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We calculated the pooled effect on agitation and psychosis for typical and atypical antipsychotics separately, and the pooled risk of adverse effects independent of the target symptom (agitation or psychosis). We used RevMan Web for the analyses. Main results The search yielded 8233 separate hits. After assessing the full‐text of 35 studies, we included 24 trials that met the eligibility criteria. Six trials tested a typical antipsychotic, four for agitation and two for psychosis. Twenty trials tested an atypical antipsychotic, eight for agitation and 12 for psychosis. Two trials tested both drug types. Seventeen of 26 comparisons were performed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease specifically. The other nine comparisons also included patients with vascular dementia or mixed dementia. Together, the studies included 6090 participants (12 to 652 per study). The trials were performed in institutionalised, hospitalised and community‐dwelling patients, or a combination of those. For typical antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, thiothixene), we are uncertain whether these drugs improve agitation compared with placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.57 to ‐0.15, 4 studies, n = 361); very low‐certainty evidence, but typical antipsychotics may improve psychosis slightly (SMD ‐0.29, 95% CI ‐0.55 to ‐0.03, 2studies, n= 240; low‐certainty evidence) compared with placebo. These drugs probably increase the risk of somnolence (risk ratio (RR) 2.62, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.56, 3 studies, n = 466; moderate‐certainty evidence) and increase extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.23, 3 studies, n = 467; high‐certainty) evidence. There was no evidence regarding the risk of any adverse event. The risks of SAEs (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.66, 1 study, n = 193) and death (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.54 to 4.00, 6 studies, n = 578) may be increased slightly, but these estimates were very imprecise, and the certainty was low. The effect estimates for haloperidol from five trials were in line with those of the drug class. Atypical antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine) probably reduce agitation slightly (SMD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.30 to ‐0.12, 7 studies, n = 1971; moderate‐certainty evidence), but probably have a negligible effect on psychosis (SMD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.18 to ‐0.03, 12 studies, n = 3364; moderate‐certainty evidence). These drugs increase the risk of somnolence (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.39, 13 studies, n ‐ 3878; high‐certainty evidence) and are probably also associated with slightly increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.68, 15 studies, n = 4180; moderate‐certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.61, 15 studies, n= 4316; moderate‐certainty evidence) and death (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.05, 17 studies, n= 5032; moderate‐certainty evidence), although the latter estimate was imprecise. The drugs probably have a negligible effect on the risk of any adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09, 11 studies, n = 2785; moderate‐certainty evidence). The findings from seven trials for risperidone were in line with those for the drug class. Authors' conclusions There is some evidence that typical antipsychotics might decrease agitation and psychosis slightly in patients with dementia. Atypical antipsychotics reduce agitation in dementia slightly, but their effect on psychosis in dementia is negligible. The apparent effectiveness of the drugs seen in daily practice may be explained by a favourable natural course of the symptoms, as observed in the placebo groups. Both drug classes increase the risk of somnolence and other adverse events. If antipsychotics are considered for sedation in patients with severe and dangerous symptoms, this should be discussed openly with the patient and legal representative. Plain language summary Do antipsychotic medicines reduce  agitated behaviour and psychotic symptoms in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia?   Key messages It is uncertain whether older, first‐generation or ‘typical’ antipsychotic medicines such as haloperidol have an effect on agitated behaviour (for example, restlessness and aggression); the effect is moderate at best. Typical antipsychotic medicines may decrease delusions and hallucinations slightly in people with dementia.  Newer, second‐generation ‘atypical’ antipsychotic medicines, such as risperidone, probably reduce agitated behaviour slightly. Atypical antipsychotic medicines probably have no effect on psychotic symptoms.  Both first‐ and second‐generation antipsychotic medicines increase the risk of drowsiness and other unwanted events. When patients’ symptoms improve after antipsychotics have been prescribed, this is probably largely due to natural improvement in symptoms over time. What are antipsychotic medicines? Antipsychotics are medicines prescribed to treat psychotic symptoms and severely disturbed behaviour in some mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and severe depression. Psychotic symptoms are delusions (very strongly held beliefs in something which is not true) and hallucinations (sensing – usually seeing or hearing ‐ things which are not really there). Antipsychotic medicines are often divided into two groups: 1. first‐generation (older) or ‘typical’ antipsychotics, for example haloperidol; 2. second‐generation (newer) or ‘atypical’ antipsychotics, for example risperidone. Both types can cause unwanted effects, such as drowsiness, movement disorders (for example, involuntary or uncontrollable movements, tremors, muscle contractions) and weight gain. Why do people with dementia need antipsychotics? People with dementia quite often experience hallucinations and delusions during their illness for some time. Particularly in the later stages of the illness, they may also show agitated behaviours such as restlessness, shouting out or aggression towards others. It is important to try to understand what is driving these behaviours and there are many ways to manage them which do not involve drugs. However, antipsychotic medicines have often been prescribed to people with dementia for these problems. In many countries, they are prescribed less often than in the past but are still used when the symptoms are severe. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know how well antipsychotic medicines reduce the severity of agitation and psychotic symptoms in people with the two commonest types of dementia, namely dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. We also wanted to know how many people experienced unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated antipsychotic medicines currently available in the USA or European Union by comparing them with placebo (a ’dummy’ pill), for treatment of persistent agitation or psychotic symptoms. People in the studies had to have Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. They could be any age and reside in a care home, a hospital, or the community. Most of the people in the studies had to be experiencing agitation (including aggression) or psychotic symptoms, or both, at the start of the study. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 24 studies with a total of 6090 people: ‐ six studies tested typical antipsychotics, mostly haloperidol;  ‐ 20 studies tested atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole; and  ‐ two studies tested both typical and atypical antipsychotics. All the studies compared antipsychotics with placebo. The people were living in institutions, hospitals, the community, or a combination of these settings. Main results Typical antipsychotics (haloperidol, thiothixene) compared with placebo: ‐ may improve symptoms of psychosis slightly (2 studies, 240 people), but we are uncertain about their effect on agitation (4 studies, 361 people);  ‐ probably increase the risk of drowsiness (3 studies, 466 people), and movement disorders (3 studies, 467 people);  ‐ may slightly increase the risk of serious unwanted effects (1 study, 193 people) and of death (6 studies, 578 people).  There was no evidence about the risk of non‐serious and serious unwanted effects combined. Atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine) compared with placebo: ‐ probably slightly reduce agitation (7 studies, 1971 people) and may slightly reduce aggression (1 study, 301 people), but probably make no important difference to symptoms of psychosis (12 studies, 3364 people); ‐ increase the risk of drowsiness (13 studies, 2878 people) and probably slightly increase movement disorders (15 studies, 4180 people); ‐ probably slightly increase the risk of experiencing any non‐serious or serious unwanted effect combined, the risk of serious unwanted effects, and the risk of death (17 studies, 5032 people). What are the limitations of the evidence? Overall, our confidence in the evidence about typical antipsychotics is limited and our confidence in the evidence about atypical antipsychotics moderate. Typical antipsychotics have been investigated in just a few studies. In addition, the studies about typical and atypical antipsychotics did not always use the best methods to carry out their investigations, or did not report the results. Consequently, the effects on agitation or psychosis may have been overestimated, and the effects on adverse events underestimated. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up‐to‐date to 7 January 2021.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease is the symptomatic predementia phase of Alzheimer's disease dementia, characterised by cognitive and functional impairment not severe enough to fulfil the criteria for dementia. In clinical samples, people with amnestic MCI are at high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease dementia, with annual rates of progression from MCI to Alzheimer's disease estimated at approximately 10% to 15% compared with the base incidence rates of Alzheimer's disease dementia of 1% to 2% per year. Objectives To assess the diagnostic accuracy of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with MCI versus the clinical follow‐up diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia as a reference standard (delayed verification). To investigate sources of heterogeneity in accuracy, such as the use of qualitative visual assessment or quantitative volumetric measurements, including manual or automatic (MRI) techniques, or the length of follow‐up, and age of participants. MRI was evaluated as an add‐on test in addition to clinical diagnosis of MCI to improve early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with MCI. Search methods On 29 January 2019 we searched Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement's Specialised Register and the databases, MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS Previews, Science Citation Index, PsycINFO, and LILACS. We also searched the reference lists of all eligible studies identified by the electronic searches. Selection criteria We considered cohort studies of any size that included prospectively recruited people of any age with a diagnosis of MCI. We included studies that compared the diagnostic test accuracy of baseline structural MRI versus the clinical follow‐up diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia (delayed verification). We did not exclude studies on the basis of length of follow‐up. We included studies that used either qualitative visual assessment or quantitative volumetric measurements of MRI to detect atrophy in the whole brain or in specific brain regions, such as the hippocampus, medial temporal lobe, lateral ventricles, entorhinal cortex, medial temporal gyrus, lateral temporal lobe, amygdala, and cortical grey matter. Data collection and analysis Four teams of two review authors each independently reviewed titles and abstracts of articles identified by the search strategy. Two teams of two review authors each independently assessed the selected full‐text articles for eligibility, extracted data and solved disagreements by consensus. Two review authors independently assessed the quality of studies using the QUADAS‐2 tool. We used the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model to fit summary ROC curves and to obtain overall measures of relative accuracy in subgroup analyses. We also used these models to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity when sufficient data sets were available. Main results We included 33 studies, published from 1999 to 2019, with 3935 participants of whom 1341 (34%) progressed to Alzheimer's disease dementia and 2594 (66%) did not. Of the participants who did not progress to Alzheimer's disease dementia, 2561 (99%) remained stable MCI and 33 (1%) progressed to other types of dementia. The median proportion of women was 53% and the mean age of participants ranged from 63 to 87 years (median 73 years). The mean length of clinical follow‐up ranged from 1 to 7.6 years (median 2 years). Most studies were of poor methodological quality due to risk of bias for participant selection or the index test, or both. Most of the included studies reported data on the volume of the total hippocampus (pooled mean sensitivity 0.73 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.80); pooled mean specificity 0.71 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.77); 22 studies, 2209 participants). This evidence was of low certainty due to risk of bias and inconsistency. Seven studies reported data on the atrophy of the medial temporal lobe (mean sensitivity 0.64 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.73); mean specificity 0.65 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.76); 1077 participants) and five studies on the volume of the lateral ventricles (mean sensitivity 0.57 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.65); mean specificity 0.64 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.70); 1077 participants). This evidence was of moderate certainty due to risk of bias. Four studies with 529 participants analysed the volume of the total entorhinal cortex and four studies with 424 participants analysed the volume of the whole brain. We did not estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity for the volume of these two regions because available data were sparse and heterogeneous. We could not statistically evaluate the volumes of the lateral temporal lobe, amygdala, medial temporal gyrus, or cortical grey matter assessed in small individual studies. We found no evidence of a difference between studies in the accuracy of the total hippocampal volume with regards to duration of follow‐up or age of participants, but the manual MRI technique was superior to automatic techniques in mixed (mostly indirect) comparisons. We did not assess the relative accuracy of the volumes of different brain regions measured by MRI because only indirect comparisons were available, studies were heterogeneous, and the overall accuracy of all regions was moderate. Authors' conclusions The volume of hippocampus or medial temporal lobe, the most studied brain regions, showed low sensitivity and specificity and did not qualify structural MRI as a stand‐alone add‐on test for an early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with MCI. This is consistent with international guidelines, which recommend imaging to exclude non‐degenerative or surgical causes of cognitive impairment and not to diagnose dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. In view of the low quality of most of the included studies, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. Future research should not focus on a single biomarker, but rather on combinations of biomarkers to improve an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia. Plain language summary How accurate is magnetic resonance imaging for the early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with mild cognitive impairment? Why is improving Alzheimer ' s disease diagnosis important? Cognitive impairment is when people have problems remembering, learning, concentrating and making decisions. People with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) generally have more memory problems than other people of their age, but these problems are not severe enough to be classified as dementia. Studies have shown that people with MCI and loss of memory are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease dementia (approximately 10% to 15% of cases per year) than people without MCI (1% to 2% per year). Currently, the only reliable way of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease dementia is to follow people with MCI and assess cognitive changes over the years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may detect changes in the brain structures that indicate the beginning of Alzheimer's disease. Early diagnosis of MCI due to Alzheimer's disease is important because people with MCI could benefit from early treatment to prevent or delay cognitive decline. What was the aim of this review? To assess the diagnostic accuracy of MRI for the early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with MCI. What was studied in the review? The volume of several brain regions was measured with MRI. Most studies (22 studies, 2209 participants) measured the volume of the hippocampus, a region of the brain that is associated primarily with memory. What are the main results in this review? Thirty‐three studies were eligible, in which 3935 participants with MCI were included and followed up for two or three years to see if they developed Alzheimer's disease dementia. About a third of them converted to Alzheimer's disease dementia, and the others did not or developed other types of dementia. We found that MRI is not accurate enough to identify people with MCI who will develop dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The correct prediction of Alzheimer's disease would be missed in 81 out of 300 people with MCI (false negatives) and a wrong prediction of Alzheimer's disease would be made in 203 out of 700 people with MCI (false positives). As a result, people with a false‐negative diagnosis would be falsely reassured and would not prepare themselves to cope with Alzheimer's disease, while those with a false‐positive diagnosis would suffer from the wrongly anticipated diagnosis. How reliable are the results of the studies? The included studies diagnosed Alzheimer's disease dementia by assessing all participants with standard clinical criteria after two or three years' follow‐up. We had some concerns about how the studies were conducted, since the participants were mainly selected from clinical registries and referral centres, and we also had concerns about how studies interpreted MRI. Moreover, the studies were conducted differently from each other, and they used different methods to select people with MCI and perform MRI. Who do the results of this review apply to? The results do not apply to people with MCI in the community, but only to people with MCI who attend memory clinics or referral centres. What are the implications of this review? MRI, as a single test, is not accurate for the early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with MCI since one in three or four participants received a wrong diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Future research should not focus on a single test (such as MRI), but rather on combinations of tests to improve an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia. How up to date is this review? This evidence is up to date to 29 January 2019.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Current treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) provide modest symptomatic relief but do not slow the progression of the disease. Latrepirdine may modulate several targets involved in AD pathology, including lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial permeability, voltage‐gated calcium ion channels as well as neurotransmitter receptor activity, and thus potentially represents both a symptomatic and disease‐modifying intervention. Several randomized, placebo‐controlled trials have sought to evaluate the effect of latrepirdine on cognition, function and behaviour in patients with AD. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of latrepirdine for the treatment of AD. Search methods We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 4 June 2014 using the terms: latrepirdine OR dimebon OR dimebolin OR 2,3,4,5‐tetrahydro‐2,8‐dimethyl‐5‐ (2‐(6‐methyl‐3‐pyridyl)ethyl)‐1H‐pyrido(4,3‐b)indole. Selection criteria We included all randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials where latrepirdine was administered to patients with mild, moderate or severe AD. Data collection and analysis We assessed the quality of studies and two authors extracted data. We calculated mean difference (MD), risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) basis for all relevant outcome measures. Main results Seven trials involving a total of 1697 participants were found and six were included in the quantitative analyses. No data were available from the seventh trial. Three trials involving 1243 patients were included in analyses of efficacy outcomes, and four trials involving 1034 patients were included in analyses of safety and tolerability outcomes. We judged five trials to be at high risk of bias due to selective outcome reporting and three to be at high risk of attrition bias. There was low quality evidence favouring latrepirdine on the Clinician's Interview ‐ Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input after 26 weeks (CIBIC‐Plus) (MD ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐0.89 to ‐0.31, 1 study, P < 0.001). Due to imprecision in the results, it was not possible to determine whether latrepirdine had any effect on cognition measured with the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS‐Cog) (MD ‐1.49, 95% CI ‐3.47 to 0.49, 3 studies, P = 0.14) or the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) (MD 0.59, 95% CI ‐0.94 to 2.11, 3 studies, P = 0.45), or on function measured with the Alzheimer’s Disease Co‐operative Study ‐ Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS‐ADL) (MD 1.00, 95% CI ‐1.15 to 3.15, 3 studies, P = 0.36) at study endpoint (26 or 52 weeks). We considered the evidence provided on these outcomes to be of overall low quality. However, there was some high quality evidence showing a very small benefit of latrepirdine on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (MD ‐1.77, 95% CI ‐3.09 to ‐0.45, 3 studies, P = 0.009) at study endpoint (26 or 52 weeks). Additionally, moderate quality evidence suggested that latrepirdine and placebo were comparable in adverse events (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14, P = 0.51), serious adverse events (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.35, P = 0.52), dropouts (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.27, P = 0.57) and dropouts due to adverse events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.67, P = 0.93). Authors' conclusions Our meta‐analysis is limited by the small number of studies, imprecision, inconsistencies between studies and likelihood of bias. Nevertheless, the evidence to date suggests that while not associated with an increased risk of adverse events compared with placebo, there is no effect of latrepirdine on cognition and function in mild‐to‐moderate AD patients, though there appears to be a modest benefit for behaviour. Further studies should investigate the potential benefit of latrepirdine on neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD. Plain language summary Dimebon for Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a degenerative disorder of the brain. It is expected to be four times more common in 2050 than it was in 2006. Common symptoms of AD include memory loss, difficulties completing daily tasks, and changes in mood, behaviour and personality. Currently approved drug treatments for AD have only modest benefits and have not been shown to slow down the progression of the disease. There is a need for more effective drugs. Latrepirdine (also known as Dimebon) has been suggested as a potential treatment for AD and other dementias. Clinical studies have had conflicting findings, so we conducted a systematic review and pooled all the available data to assess the effects of latrepirdine. We looked for studies to help us answer this question by conducting a literature search in June 2014. We combined data from seven studies with a total of 1697 patients with AD. We were unable to conclude whether latrepirdine has any beneficial effect on cognition and function in people with AD due to variations in the results between studies and because the effects we estimated were too imprecise. However, the evidence suggests that latrepirdine may have a positive effect in treating behavioural symptoms, and that it is not associated with adverse effects in people with AD. Although seven studies have been done, data from only six studies were available and most of the studies were not fully reported. We contacted the investigators for additional data but received no response.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. One of the therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in the brain by the use of cholinesterase inhibitors to delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts. Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Other cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, with superior properties in terms of specificity of action and lower risk of adverse effects have since been introduced. Rivastigmine has received approval for use in 60 countries including all member states of the European Union and the USA. Objectives To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of rivastigmine for patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, on 2 March 2015 using the terms: Rivastigmine OR  exelon OR ENA OR "SDZ ENA 713". ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. Selection criteria We included all unconfounded, double‐blind, randomised, controlled trials in which treatment with rivastigmine was administered to patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type for 12 weeks or more and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients, or where two formulations of rivastigmine were compared. Data collection and analysis One review author (JSB) applied the study selection criteria, assessed the quality of studies and extracted data. Main results A total of 13 trials met the inclusion criteria of the review. The trials had a duration of between 12 and 52 weeks. The older trials tested a capsule form with a dose of up to 12 mg/day. Trials reported since 2007 have tested continuous dose transdermal patch formulations delivering 4.6, 9.5 and 17.7 mg/day. Our main analysis compared the safety and efficacy of rivastigmine 6 to 12 mg/day orally or 9.5 mg/day transdermally with placebo. Seven trials contributed data from 3450 patients to this analysis. Data from another two studies were not included because of a lack of information and methodological concerns. All the included trials were multicentre trials and recruited patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with a mean age of about 75 years. All had low risk of bias for randomisation and allocation but the risk of bias due to attrition was unclear in four studies, low in one study and high in two studies. After 26 weeks of treatment rivastigmine compared to placebo was associated with better outcomes for cognitive function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale‐Cognitive (ADAS‐Cog) score (mean difference (MD) ‐1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.21 to ‐1.37, n = 3232, 6 studies) and the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (MD 0.74; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.97, n = 3205, 6 studies), activities of daily living (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.27, n = 3230, 6 studies) and clinician rated global impression of changes, with a smaller proportion of patients treated with rivastigmine experiencing no change or a deterioration (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.80, n = 3338, 7 studies). Three studies reported behavioural change, and there were no differences compared to placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.04; 95% CI ‐0.14 to 0.06, n = 1529, 3 studies). Only one study measured the impact on caregivers using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory‐Caregiver Distress (NPI‐D) scale and this found no difference between the groups (MD 0.10; 95% CI ‐0.91 to 1.11, n = 529, 1 study). Overall, participants who received rivastigmine were about twice as likely to withdraw from the trials (odds ratio (OR) 2.01, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.37, n = 3569, 7 studies) or to experience an adverse event during the trials (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.82 to 2.57, n = 3587, 7 studies). Authors' conclusions Rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg daily orally or 9.5 mg daily transdermally) appears to be beneficial for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. In comparisons with placebo, better outcomes were observed for rate of decline of cognitive function and activities of daily living, although the effects were small and of uncertain clinical importance. There was also a benefit from rivastigmine on the outcome of clinician's global assessment. There were no differences between the rivastigmine group and placebo group in behavioural change or impact on carers. At these doses the transdermal patch may have fewer side effects than the capsules but has comparable efficacy. The quality of evidence is only moderate for all of the outcomes reviewed because of a risk of bias due to dropouts. All the studies with usable data were industry funded or sponsored. This review has not examined economic data. Plain language summary Rivastigmine for people with Alzheimer's disease Review question We reviewed evidence comparing the effectiveness and safety of rivastigmine with placebo in people with Alzheimer's disease.  Background Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. As the disease progresses, people lose the ability to remember, communicate, think clearly and perform the usual daily activities. Their behaviour or personality may also change. In severe Alzheimer's disease, the patients lose the ability to care for themselves and require full time care. Currently, there is no cure available for Alzheimer's disease, but a few pharmacological interventions are available to alleviate symptoms. The symptoms are caused by the loss of a type of nerve cell in the brain called cholinergic neurons. Rivastigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, works by increasing the levels of a brain chemical called acetylcholine which allows the nerve cells to communicate. This may improve the symptoms of dementia. Rivastigmine can be taken orally, either as capsules or a liquid, or by applying a patch on the skin. Its effectiveness in improving the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and safety were evaluated in this review. Study characteristics This review included double‐blinded randomised controlled trials, and the evidence was searched for up to March 2015 using the standard Cochrane methods. The review included studies conducted for at least 12 weeks that compared the safety and effectiveness of rivastigmine compared with placebo. Thirteen studies that met these criteria were found. Most of these studies involved people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with an average age of around 75 years. Key results Results from seven trials showed that patients on rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg/day by mouth, or 9.5 mg/day by skin patch) were better for three outcomes than those on placebo, after six months of treatment. The differences were quite small for cognitive function (2 points, using the ADAS‐Cog which has a range of 70 points) and activities of daily living (standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.20, which is considered a small effect). Patients on rivastigmine were more likely to show overall improvement compared with those on placebo (odds ratio of 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.25 to 1.72) . However, there was no difference for behavioural changes (reported by three trials) or impact on carers (reported by one trial). Patients on rivastigmine were also about twice as likely to experience adverse events, although this risk might have been slightly less for patients using patches compared with capsules. It was possible that certain types of adverse events were less in people using patches than taking capsules (nausea, vomiting, weight loss, dizziness). In summary, rivastigmine may be of benefit to people with Alzheimer's disease. It is possible that the using a patch is associated with reduced side effects compared to using oral capsules. Quality of evidence The quality of the evidence for most of the outcomes reviewed was moderate. The main factors affecting our confidence in the results included relatively high number of patients dropping out in some of the trials (the rates of dropout in the rivastigmine arms were higher). There were also concerns about the applicability of the evidence for the long term treatment of Alzheimer's disease since data from double‐blinded randomised controlled trials were only available for up to 12 months. All the data included in the main analysis of this review came from studies either sponsored or funded by the drug manufacturer (Novartis Pharma).},

abstract = {Abstract - Background  18 F‐florbetaben uptake by brain tissue, measured by positron emission tomography (PET), is accepted by regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agencies (EMA) for assessing amyloid load in people with dementia. Its added value is mainly demonstrated by excluding Alzheimer's pathology in an established dementia diagnosis. However, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA‐AA) revised the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease and confidence in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease may be increased when using some amyloid biomarkers tests like  18 F‐florbetaben. These tests, added to the MCI core clinical criteria, might increase the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of a testing strategy. However, the DTA of  18 F‐florbetaben to predict the progression from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia (ADD) or other dementias has not yet been systematically evaluated. Objectives To determine the DTA of the  18 F‐florbetaben PET scan for detecting people with MCI at time of performing the test who will clinically progress to ADD, other forms of dementia (non‐ADD), or any form of dementia at follow‐up. Search methods The most recent search for this review was performed in May 2017. We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), BIOSIS Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), Web of Science Core Collection, including the Science Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science) and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov ( https://clinicaltrials.gov ), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) ( http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/ ). We also searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia & Cognitive Improvement Group’s specialised register of dementia studies ( http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois/ ). We checked the reference lists of any relevant studies and systematic reviews, and performed citation tracking using the Science Citation Index to identify any additional relevant studies. No language or date restrictions were applied to electronic searches. Selection criteria We included studies that had prospectively defined cohorts with any accepted definition of MCI at time of performing the test and the use of  18 F‐florbetaben scan to evaluate the DTA of the progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia. In addition, we only selected studies that applied a reference standard for Alzheimer’s dementia diagnosis, for example, the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS‐ADRDA) or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders‐IV (DSM‐IV) criteria. Data collection and analysis We screened all titles and abstracts identified in electronic‐database searches. Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data to create two‐by‐two tables, showing the binary test results cross‐classified with the binary reference standard. We used these data to calculate sensitivities, specificities, and their 95% confidence intervals. Two independent assessors performed quality assessment using the QUADAS‐2 tool plus some additional items to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Main results Progression from MCI to ADD, any other form of dementia, and any form of dementia was evaluated in one study (Ong 2015). It reported data on 45 participants at four years of follow‐up; 21 participants met NINCDS‐ADRDA criteria for Alzheimer’s disease dementia at four years of follow‐up, the proportion converting to ADD was 47% of the 45 participants, and 11% of the 45 participants met criteria for other types of dementias (three cases of FrontoTemporal Dementia (FTD), one of Dementia with Lewy body (DLB), and one of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)). We considered the study to be at high risk of bias in the domains of the reference standard, flow, and timing (QUADAS‐2). MCI to ADD ;  18 F‐florbetaben PET scan analysed visually: the sensitivity was 100% (95% confidence interval (CI) 84% to 100%) and the specificity was 83% (95% CI 63% to 98%) (n = 45, 1 study). Analysed quantitatively: the sensitivity was 100% (95% CI 84% to 100%) and the specificity was 88% (95% CI 68% to 97%) for the diagnosis of ADD at follow‐up (n = 45, 1 study). MCI to any other form of dementia (non‐ADD);   18 F‐florbetaben PET scan analysed visually: the sensitivity was 0% (95% CI 0% to 52%) and the specificity was 38% (95% CI 23% to 54%) (n = 45, 1 study). Analysed quantitatively: the sensitivity was 0% (95% CI 0% to 52%) and the specificity was 40% (95% CI 25% to 57%) for the diagnosis of any other form of dementia at follow‐up (n = 45, 1 study). MCI to any form of dementia ; 18 F‐florbetaben PET scan analysed visually: the sensitivity was 81% (95% CI 61% to 93%) and the specificity was 79% (95% CI 54% to 94%) (n = 45, 1 study). Analysed quantitatively: the sensitivity was 81% (95% CI 61% to 93%) and the specificity was 84% (95% CI 60% to 97%) for the diagnosis of any form of dementia at follow‐up (n = 45, 1 study). Authors' conclusions Although we were able to calculate one estimation of DTA in, especially, the prediction of progression from MCI to ADD at four years follow‐up, the small number of participants implies imprecision of sensitivity and specificity estimates. We cannot make any recommendation regarding the routine use of  18 F‐florbetaben in clinical practice based on one single study with 45 participants.  18 F‐florbetaben has high financial costs, therefore, clearly demonstrating its DTA and standardising the process of the  18 F‐florbetaben modality are important prior to its wider use. Plain language summary 18 F PET with florbetaben for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment Review question:  In people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), does using a  18 F PET scan with florbetaben predict progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) and other dementias? Background  Due to global ageing, the number of people with dementia is expected to increase dramatically in the next few decades. Diagnosing dementia at an early stage is desirable, but there is no widespread agreement on the best approach. A range of simple pen and paper tests used by healthcare professionals can assess people with poor memory or cognitive impairment. Whether or not using special PET scans that detect amyloid —one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease— improves our ability to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia remains unclear. Since these tests are expensive, it is important that they provide additional benefits. Aim We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the  18 F‐florbetaben PET scan in identifying those people with MCI who clinically progress to ADD, other types of dementia, or any form of dementia over a period of time. Study characteristics  The evidence is current to May 2017. We found 1 study including 45 participants with MCI with a follow‐up of 4 years; gender was not reported and the median age for those with a PET‐positive scan by quantitative assessment was 73.5 years old. For those with a PET‐negative scan the mean age was 71.8 years old. Participants were mainly recruited from local memory clinics. Study funding sources: the study was funded by the test manufacturer. Quality of the evidence  The main limitation of this review was that our findings were based on only one study, with not enough details on how the participants were selected. The study was considered to be at high risk of bias, since the final ADD diagnosis was not established separately from the scan results, and due to potential conflicts of interest detected. Key findings  In this review, based on only one study, we found that the  18 F‐florbetaben PET scan, as a single test with visual assessment, correctly classified 100% of the participants who will progress to ADD and 83% of the participants who did not progress to ADD at four years follow‐up. This means that in a cohort with 100 participants with MCI, 47 of whom will progress to ADD, we would expect that all those 47 MCI participants would test positive with the  18 F‐florbetaben scan and that 0 participants would be falsely negative (i.e. none of the 47 participants would have a negative test and yet progress to ADD). In addition, we would expect 44 of 53 participants who did not progress to ADD to be  18 F‐florbetaben‐negative and 9 to be falsely positive (i.e. 9 of the 53 participants would have a positive test but not progress to ADD). The small size of the included study lowered our confidence on these estimates of accuracy and it is still possible that the test is considerably less accurate than these results suggest. We conclude that  18 F‐florbetaben imaging is a promising test to predict the progression from MCI to ADD; however, we need more studies to clearly demonstrate its accuracy.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Dementia is a syndrome that comprises many differing pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD), vascular dementia (VaD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). People may benefit from knowing the type of dementia they live with, as this could inform prognosis and may allow for tailored treatment. Beta‐amyloid (1‐42) (ABeta42) is a protein which decreases in both the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of people living with ADD, when compared to people with no dementia. However, it is not clear if changes in ABeta42 are specific to ADD or if they are also seen in other types of dementia. It is possible that ABeta42 could help differentiate ADD from other dementia subtypes. Objectives To determine the accuracy of plasma and CSF ABeta42 for distinguishing ADD from other dementia subtypes in people who meet the criteria for a dementia syndrome. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, and nine other databases up to 18 February 2020. We checked reference lists of any relevant systematic reviews to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We considered cross‐sectional studies that differentiated people with ADD from other dementia subtypes. Eligible studies required measurement of participant plasma or CSF ABeta42 levels and clinical assessment for dementia subtype. Data collection and analysis Seven review authors working independently screened the titles and abstracts generated by the searches. We collected data on study characteristics and test accuracy. We used the second version of the 'Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies' (QUADAS‐2) tool to assess internal and external validity of results. We extracted data into 2 x 2 tables, cross‐tabulating index test results (ABeta42) with the reference standard (diagnostic criteria for each dementia subtype). We performed meta‐analyses using bivariate, random‐effects models. We calculated pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In the primary analysis, we assessed accuracy of plasma or CSF ABeta42 for distinguishing ADD from other mixed dementia types (non‐ADD). We then assessed accuracy of ABeta42 for differentiating ADD from specific dementia types: VaD, FTD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), alcohol‐related cognitive disorder (ARCD), Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease (CJD) and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). To determine test‐positive cases, we used the ABeta42 thresholds employed in the respective primary studies. We then performed sensitivity analyses restricted to those studies that used common thresholds for ABeta42. Main results We identified 39 studies (5000 participants) that used CSF ABeta42 levels to differentiate ADD from other subtypes of dementia. No studies of plasma ABeta42 met the inclusion criteria. No studies were rated as low risk of bias across all QUADAS‐2 domains. High risk of bias was found predominantly in the domains of patient selection (28 studies) and index test (25 studies). The pooled estimates for differentiating ADD from other dementia subtypes were as follows: ADD from non‐ADD: sensitivity 79% (95% CI 0.73 to 0.85), specificity 60% (95% CI 0.52 to 0.67), 13 studies, 1704 participants, 880 participants with ADD; ADD from VaD: sensitivity 79% (95% CI 0.75 to 0.83), specificity 69% (95% CI 0.55 to 0.81), 11 studies, 1151 participants, 941 participants with ADD; ADD from FTD: sensitivity 85% (95% CI 0.79 to 0.89), specificity 72% (95% CI 0.55 to 0.84), 17 studies, 1948 participants, 1371 participants with ADD; ADD from DLB: sensitivity 76% (95% CI 0.69 to 0.82), specificity 67% (95% CI 0.52 to 0.79), nine studies, 1929 participants, 1521 participants with ADD. Across all dementia subtypes, sensitivity was greater than specificity, and the balance of sensitivity and specificity was dependent on the threshold used to define test positivity. Authors' conclusions Our review indicates that measuring ABeta42 levels in CSF may help differentiate ADD from other dementia subtypes, but the test is imperfect and tends to misdiagnose those with non‐ADD as having ADD. We would caution against the use of CSF ABeta42 alone for dementia classification. However, ABeta42 may have value as an adjunct to a full clinical assessment, to aid dementia diagnosis. Plain language summary How accurate is the ABeta42 test for distinguishing Alzheimer's disease from other types of dementia in patients seen in a specialist clinic? Why is improving dementia diagnosis important? Dementia is a condition characterised by progressive problems with memory and thinking. Dementia can be caused be a number of different conditions (for example, by Alzheimer's disease), and the best treatments depend on the underlying cause. Levels of the protein ABeta42 in blood or spinal fluid may determine the underlying cause of dementia. This could help clinicians choose the best treatments. What is the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to find out how accurate are the levels of ABeta42 in blood or spinal fluid for determining the cause of dementia. What was studied in the review? We included studies that examined the levels of ABeta42 taken from samples of blood or spinal fluid. At present, this test is only used in specialist clinics. Levels of ABeta42 may be lower in persons with Alzheimer's dementia compared to those with other types of dementia. What are the main results of this review? We included 39 studies with a total of 5000 participants. All studies used spinal fluid tests of ABeta42. None of the included studies used a blood test of ABeta42. In theory, the results of these studies indicate that if ABeta42 were to be used in a specialist clinic in a group of 1000 people, where 520 (52%) have Alzheimer's dementia, an estimated 602 would have an ABeta42 result. This would indicate that Alzheimer's dementia is present. Of these, 192 (32%) would be incorrectly classified as having Alzheimer's disease. Of the 398 people with a result indicating that Alzheimer's disease is not present, 110 (28%) would be incorrectly classified as not having Alzheimer's disease. The included studies used different levels of ABeta42 to make the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and the accuracy of the test depended on the level of ABeta42 used. How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? In most of the included studies, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia was made by assessing all participants with standard diagnostic criteria.This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had Alzheimer's disease. However, there were some problems with how the studies were conducted. This may result in ABeta42 appearing more accurate than it really is. To whom do the results of this review apply? The results apply to patients undergoing dementia assessment in a specialist setting. What are the implications of this review? Measuring levels of ABeta42 in spinal fluid may help distinguish Alzheimer’s disease from other types of dementia, but the test is not perfect. ABeta42 is unlikely to be used in isolation for making a diagnosis, and may have greatest value when used in addition to the other assessments and tests that are undertaken to make a diagnosis of dementia.

abstract = {Abstract - Background  18 F‐florbetapir uptake by brain tissue measured by positron emission tomography (PET) is accepted by regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agencies (EMA) for assessing amyloid load in people with dementia. Its added value is mainly demonstrated by excluding Alzheimer's pathology in an established dementia diagnosis. However, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA‐AA) revised the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease and confidence in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease may be increased when using amyloid biomarkers tests like  18 F‐florbetapir. These tests, added to the MCI core clinical criteria, might increase the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of a testing strategy. However, the DTA of  18 F‐florbetapir to predict the progression from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia (ADD) or other dementias has not yet been systematically evaluated. Objectives To determine the DTA of the  18 F‐florbetapir PET scan for detecting people with MCI at time of performing the test who will clinically progress to ADD, other forms of dementia (non‐ADD), or any form of dementia at follow‐up. Search methods This review is current to May 2017. We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), BIOSIS Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), Web of Science Core Collection, including the Science Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science) and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov ( https://clinicaltrials.gov ), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) ( http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/ ). We also searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia & Cognitive Improvement Group’s specialised register of dementia studies ( http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois/ ). We checked the reference lists of any relevant studies and systematic reviews, and performed citation tracking using the Science Citation Index to identify any additional relevant studies. No language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic searches. Selection criteria We included studies that had prospectively defined cohorts with any accepted definition of MCI at time of performing the test and the use of  18 F‐florbetapir scan to evaluate the DTA of the progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia. In addition, we only selected studies that applied a reference standard for Alzheimer’s dementia diagnosis, for example, National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS‐ADRDA) or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders‐IV (DSM‐IV) criteria. Data collection and analysis We screened all titles and abstracts identified in electronic‐database searches. Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data to create two‐by‐two tables, showing the binary test results cross‐classified with the binary reference standard. We used these data to calculate sensitivities, specificities, and their 95% confidence intervals. Two independent assessors performed quality assessment using the QUADAS‐2 tool plus some additional items to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Main results We included three studies, two of which evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD, and one evaluated the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. Progression from MCI to ADD was evaluated in 448 participants. The studies reported data on 401 participants with 1.6 years of follow‐up and in 47 participants with three years of follow‐up. Sixty‐one (15.2%) participants converted at 1.6 years follow‐up; nine (19.1%) participants converted at three years of follow‐up. Progression from MCI to any form of dementia was evaluated in five participants with 1.5 years of follow‐up, with three (60%) participants converting to any form of dementia. There were concerns regarding applicability in the reference standard in all three studies. Regarding the domain of flow and timing, two studies were considered at high risk of bias. MCI to ADD ; Progression from MCI to ADD in those with a follow‐up between two to less than four years had a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI 30 to 93) and a specificity of 71% (95% CI 54 to 85) by visual assessment (n = 47, 1 study). Progression from MCI to ADD in those with a follow‐up between one to less than two years had a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 78 to 95) and a specificity of 58% (95% CI 53 to 64) by visual assessment, and a sensitivity of 87% (95% CI 76 to 94) and a specificity of 51% (95% CI 45 to 56) by quantitative assessment by the standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR)(n = 401, 1 study). MCI to any form of dementia ; Progression from MCI to any form of dementia in those with a follow‐up between one to less than two years had a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI 9 to 99) and a specificity of 50% (95% CI 1 to 99) by visual assessment (n = 5, 1 study). MCI to any other forms of dementia (non‐ADD) ; There was no information regarding the progression from MCI to any other form of dementia (non‐ADD). Authors' conclusions Although sensitivity was good in one included study, considering the poor specificity and the limited data available in the literature, we cannot recommend routine use of  18 F‐florbetapir PET in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to ADD. Because of the poor sensitivity and specificity, limited number of included participants, and the limited data available in the literature, we cannot recommend its routine use in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. Because of the high financial costs of  18 F‐florbetapir, clearly demonstrating the DTA and standardising the process of this modality are important prior to its wider use. Plain language summary 18 F‐florbetapir PET scan for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment Review question:  In people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), does using a  18 F PET scan with florbetapir predict the progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) and other dementias? Background Due to global ageing, the number of people with dementia is expected to increase dramatically in the next few decades. Diagnosing dementia at an early stage is desirable, but there is no widespread agreement on the best approach. A range of simple pen and paper tests used by healthcare professionals can assess people with poor memory or cognitive impairment. Whether or not using special PET scans that detect amyloid —one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease— improves our ability to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia remains unclear. Since these tests are expensive, it is important that they provide additional benefits. Aim We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the  18 F‐florbetapir PET scan in identifying those people with MCI who clinically progress to ADD, other types of dementia, or any form of dementia over a period of time. Study characteristics The evidence is current to May 2017. We found three studies including 453 participants with MCI. Two studies evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD and one study evaluated the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. Regarding the two studies that evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD, one study had 401 participants with a follow‐up of 1.6 years and the mean age was 72 years. The other study had 47 participants with a follow‐up of three years, and the mean age was 72 years. The other study that looked at any form of dementia included 5 participants over 90 years old. Two of the studies were funded by the test manufacturer. Quality of the evidence The main limitation of this review was that our findings were based on only three studies, with insufficient detail on how the people were selected, whether the information from the scan was assessed separately from the final diagnosis. The studies were considered to be at high risk of bias due to potential conflicts of interest detected. Key findings In this review, we found the following results based on the three studies. At a follow‐up of 1.6 years, using visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 89% of the participants who progressed to ADD but only 58% of the participants who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 15% of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 of 15 people to have a positive result and the other 2 participants to be falsely negative. Also 49 people who will not develop ADD would have a negative result, but 36 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). In the study that followed up people for three years and used visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 67% of people who progressed to ADD and 71% who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 19 of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 people to have a positive result of the scan and 6 people to have a falsely negative result. In addition, 58 of 81 participants who will not progress to ADD would have a negative result, but 23 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). The small number of participants evaluated at three years lowered our confidence on these estimates of accuracy. Regarding progression to any form of dementia, the extremely small number of participants meant that we were unable to provide meaningful estimates of accuracy. We conclude that  18 F‐florbetapir PET scans cannot be recommended for routine use in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or any form of dementia based on the currently available data. More studies are needed to demonstrate its usefulness.},

Main results Progression from MCI to ADD was evaluated in 243 participants from two studies. The studies reported data on 19 participants with two years of follow‐up and on 224 participants with three years of follow‐up. Nine (47.4%) participants converted at two years follow‐up and 81 (36.2%) converted at three years of follow‐up. There were concerns about participant selection and sampling in both studies.

Study characteristics The evidence is current to May 2017. We found two studies evaluating the progression from MCI to ADD. The studies included 252 MCI eligible participants, with 243 participants that had follow‐up. Of these, 127 were women. The average age in one study with two years of follow‐up was 72.7  +  7.09 years. In the other study with three years of follow‐up, the average age was 71.1  +  8.62 years. The setting in one study was memory clinics. Study funding sources: both studies were funded by the test manufacturer. Quality of the evidence The main limitation of this review was that our findings were based on only two studies, with not enough details on how the people were selected, how the interpretation of the PET scan was made in one study, how the clinical diagnosis of dementia was established in the other study. The studies were considered to be at high risk of bias due to potential conflicts of interest detected. Key findings In this review, we found that the  18 F‐flutemetamol PET scan, as a single test, in one study with 19 participants included with 2 years of follow‐up, had a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 80%. This means that in a cohort with 100 participants with MCI and a proportion of progression in this study of 47%, we would expect 42 of 47 MCI participants with a positive result for  18 F‐flutemetamol scan to progress to ADD, and 5 participants to be falsely positive. In addition, we would expect 42 of 53 participants who will not progress to ADD to have a negative result for  18 F‐flutemetamol, and 11 to be falsely negative. In the other study with 224 participants included in the analysis with 3 years follow‐up, the sensitivity was 64% and the specificity was 69%. This means that in a cohort with 100 participants with MCI and a proportion of progression in this study of 36%, we would expect 23 of 36 MCI participants with a positive result for  18 F‐flutemetamol to progress to ADD, and 13 participants to be falsely positive. In addition, we would expect 44 of 64 participants who will not progress to ADD to have a negative result for  18 F‐flutemetamol, and 20 to be falsely negative. There was no information regarding the progression from MCI to other forms of dementia and progression to any form of dementia at follow‐up. We conclude that  18 F‐flutemetamol PET imaging cannot be recommended for routine use in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to ADD based on the currently available data. More studies are needed to clearly demonstrate its usefulness.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Cognitive impairments affect functional ability in people with dementia. Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) is a personalised, solution‐focused approach that aims to enable people with mild‐to‐moderate dementia to manage everyday activities and maintain as much independence as possible. Objectives To evaluate the effects of CR on everyday functioning and other outcomes for people with mild‐to‐moderate dementia, and on outcomes for care partners. To identify and explore factors that may be associated with the efficacy of CR. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, which contains records from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, and other clinical trial databases, and grey literature sources. The most recent search was completed on 19 October 2022. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CR with control conditions and reporting relevant outcomes for the person with dementia and/or the care partner. Data collection and analysis We extracted relevant data from published manuscripts and contacted trial authors if necessary. Within each of the comparisons, we pooled data for each outcome of interest and conducted inverse‐variance, random‐effects meta‐analyses. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADEpro GDT. Main results We identified six eligible RCTs published in English between 2010 and 2022, which together included 1702 participants. The mean age of participants ranged from 76 to 80 and the proportion of male participants was between 29.4% and 79.3%. Most participants, in the studies where the type of dementia was reported, had a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD; n = 1002, 58.9% of the whole sample, 81.2% of the participants for whom the specific diagnosis was reported). Risk of bias in the individual studies was relatively low. The exception was a high risk of bias in relation to blinding of participants and practitioners, which is not usually feasible with psychosocial interventions.  Our primary outcome of everyday functioning was operationalised in the included studies as goal attainment in relation to activities targeted in the intervention. For our main comparison of CR with usual care, we pooled data for goal attainment evaluated from three perspectives (self‐rating of performance, informant rating of performance, and self‐rating of satisfaction with performance) at end of treatment and at medium‐term follow‐up (3 to 12 months). We could also pool data at these time points for 20 and 19 secondary outcomes respectively. The review findings were strongly driven by one large, high‐quality RCT.  We found high‐certainty evidence of large positive effects of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives at the end of treatment: participant self‐ratings of goal attainment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 1.66; I 2  = 0%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.61, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21; I 2  = 41%; 3 RCTs, 476 participants), and self‐ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.31, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.54; I 2  = 5%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. At medium‐term follow‐up, we found high‐certainty evidence showing a large positive effect of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives: participant self‐ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.46, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.68; I 2  = 0%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.25, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.72; I 2  = 29%; 3 RCTs, 446 participants), and self‐ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.66; I 2  = 28%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. For participants at the end of treatment we found high‐certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on self‐efficacy (2 RCTs, 456 participants) and immediate recall (2 RCTs, 459 participants). For participants at medium‐term follow‐up we found moderate‐certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on auditory selective attention (2 RCTs, 386 participants), and a small negative effect on general functional ability (3 RCTs, 673 participants), and we found low‐certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on sustained attention (2 RCTs, 413 participants), and a small negative effect on memory (2 RCTs, 51 participants) and anxiety (3 RCTs, 455 participants).  We found moderate‐ and low‐certainty evidence indicating that at the end of treatment CR had negligible effects on participant anxiety, quality of life, sustained attention, memory, delayed recall, and general functional ability, and at medium‐term follow‐up on participant self‐efficacy, depression, quality of life, immediate recall, and verbal fluency. For care partners at the end of treatment we found low‐certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on environmental aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 465 care partners), and small negative effects of CR on level of depression (2 RCTs, 32 care partners) and on psychological wellbeing (2 RCTs, 388 care partners).  For care partners at medium‐term follow‐up we found high‐certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on social aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 436 care partners) and moderate‐certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on psychological aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 437 care partners). We found moderate‐ and low‐certainty evidence at the end of treatment that CR had negligible effects on care partners’ physical health, psychological and social aspects of quality of life, and stress, and at medium‐term follow‐up for the physical health aspect of care partners’ quality of life and psychological wellbeing. Authors' conclusions CR is helpful in enabling people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage the everyday activities targeted in the intervention. Confidence in these findings could be strengthened if more high‐quality studies contributed to the observed effects. The available evidence suggests that CR can form a valuable part of a clinical toolkit to assist people with dementia in overcoming some of the everyday barriers imposed by cognitive and functional difficulties. Future research, including process evaluation studies, could help identify avenues to maximise CR effects and achieve wider impacts on functional ability and wellbeing.  Plain language summary What are the benefits and risks of cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild‐to‐moderate dementia? Key messages Cognitive rehabilitation helps people living with dementia to manage everyday activities that are important to them. Future studies could explore how to use cognitive rehabilitation to also improve overall functioning and wellbeing. What is dementia? Dementia is a group of symptoms caused by changes in the brain that get worse over time. People with some types of dementia have difficulties with memory, planning, concentrating, and communicating. These and other thinking difficulties are collectively described by the umbrella term, 'cognitive impairment'. Cognitive impairment makes it harder to do daily activities and stay independent for as long as possible. What is cognitive rehabilitation? Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalised intervention. People have one‐to‐one sessions with a practitioner, usually in their own home. People identify everyday activities and tasks that they would like to manage better or do more independently. The practitioner suggests strategies and works with them to help achieve these improvements in the activities that are important to them. Family members are often involved as well. What did we want to find out? We explored whether cognitive rehabilitation was better than usual treatment for: doing a chosen task or activity that matters to the person; managing daily activities; feeling confident about being able to manage things; feeling depressed or anxious; having a sense of wellbeing. We also explored whether cognitive rehabilitation was better for ensuring the wellbeing of the care partner ‐ usually a husband, wife, or other close family member.  What did we do?  We searched for studies that rigorously tested the effects of cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild‐to‐moderate dementia. In these studies, some people had their usual treatment and others had their usual treatment plus cognitive rehabilitation. This made it possible to see whether cognitive rehabilitation was more helpful than usual treatment alone. We compared and summarised the results of the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence the studies provided, based on the methods used and the numbers of people involved. What did we find?  We found six studies. They involved 1702 people with mild‐to‐moderate dementia, who had between 8 and 14 sessions with a cognitive rehabilitation practitioner. Alzheimer’s disease was the most common dementia diagnosis (59% of all participants, 82% of participants with the specific diagnosis reported). The main findings are that, compared to people who just had their usual treatment, people who had cognitive rehabilitation got better at doing their chosen tasks or activities.  This improvement was seen by the people with dementia and by their care partners. The improvement was seen straight after cognitive rehabilitation and was still noticeable 3 to 12 months later. Other results Straight after cognitive rehabilitation, compared to people who just had their usual treatment, people with dementia may feel more confident about how they are managing. There might not be any differences in the wellbeing of people with dementia and their care partners. We are not sure if there are any differences for people with dementia in managing other tasks or activities or in feeling depressed. Three to 12 months after cognitive rehabilitation, compared to usual treatment, care partners may have better psychological wellbeing.  There may not be any differences in how well people with dementia manage other tasks or activities, in how confident or depressed they feel, or in their wellbeing. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our review included six studies, but the findings are based mostly on information from one large study. We do not know if the effects of cognitive rehabilitation last more than a year. Results for several effects of cognitive rehabilitation were not clear. How up‐to‐date is this evidence? The evidence is up‐to‐date to October 2022.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Anticholinergics are medications that block the action of acetylcholine in the central or peripheral nervous system. Medications with anticholinergic properties are commonly prescribed to older adults. The cumulative anticholinergic effect of all the medications a person takes is referred to as the anticholinergic burden. A high anticholinergic burden may cause cognitive impairment in people who are otherwise cognitively healthy, or cause further cognitive decline in people with pre‐existing cognitive problems. Reducing anticholinergic burden through deprescribing interventions may help to prevent onset of cognitive impairment or slow the rate of cognitive decline. Objectives Primary objective • To assess the efficacy and safety of anticholinergic medication reduction interventions for improving cognitive outcomes in cognitively healthy older adults and older adults with pre‐existing cognitive issues. Secondary Objectives • To compare the effectiveness of different types of reduction interventions (e.g. pharmacist‐led versus general practitioner‐led, educational versus audit and feedback) for reducing overall anticholinergic burden.• To establish optimal duration of anticholinergic reduction interventions, sustainability, and lessons learnt for upscaling• To compare results according to differing anticholinergic scales used in medication reduction intervention trials• To assess the efficacy of anticholinergic medication reduction interventions for improving other clinical outcomes, including mortality, quality of life, clinical global impression, physical function, institutionalisation, falls, cardiovascular diseases, and neurobehavioral outcomes. Search methods We searched CENTRAL on 22 December 2022, and we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and three other databases from inception to 1 November 2022. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions that aimed to reduce anticholinergic burden in older people and that investigated cognitive outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. The data were not suitable for meta‐analysis, so we summarised them narratively. We used GRADE methods to rate our confidence in the review results. Main results We included three trials with a total of 299 participants. All three trials were conducted in a cognitively mixed population (some cognitively healthy participants, some participants with dementia). Outcomes were assessed after one to three months. One trial reported significantly improved performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) in the intervention group (treatment difference 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 1.30), although there was no difference between the groups in the proportion of participants with reduced anticholinergic burden. Two trials successfully reduced anticholinergic burden in the intervention group. Of these, one reported no significant difference between the intervention versus control in terms of their effect on cognitive performance measured by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) immediate recall (mean between‐group difference 0.54, 95% CI −0.91 to 2.05), CERAD delayed recall (mean between‐group difference −0.23, 95% CI−0.85 to 0.38), CERAD recognition (mean between‐group difference 0.77, 95% CI −0.39 to 1.94), and Mini‐Mental State Examination (mean between‐group difference 0.39, 95% CI −0.96 to 1.75). The other trial reported a significant correlation between anticholinergic burden and a test of working memory after the intervention (which suggested reducing the burden improved performance), but reported no effect on multiple other cognitive measures. In GRADE terms, the results were of very low certainty. There were no reported between‐group differences for any other clinical outcome we investigated. It was not possible to investigate differences according to type of reduction intervention or type of anticholinergic scale, to measure the sustainability of interventions, or to establish lessons learnt for upscaling. No trials investigated safety outcomes. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to reach any conclusions on the effects of anticholinergic burden reduction interventions on cognitive outcomes in older adults with or without prior cognitive impairment. The evidence from RCTs was of very low certainty so cannot support or refute the hypothesis that actively reducing or stopping prescription of medications with anticholinergic properties can improve cognitive outcomes in older people. There is no evidence from RCTs that anticholinergic burden reduction interventions improve other clinical outcomes such as mortality, quality of life, clinical global impression, physical function, institutionalisation, falls, cardiovascular diseases, or neurobehavioral outcomes. Larger RCTs investigating long‐term outcomes are needed. Future RCTs should also investigate potential benefits of anticholinergic reduction interventions in cognitively healthy populations and cognitively impaired populations separately. Plain language summary Can reducing prescriptions of anticholinergic medicines improve cognitive outcomes in older adults? Key messages • It is known that older people who take more medicines with an anticholinergic effect may be at greater risk of cognitive decline.• There is a lack of high‐quality evidence to show whether reducing prescriptions of anticholinergic medicines can preserve or improve cognition. Current evidence is very uncertain and very short‐term.• There is a need for large trials to investigate long‐term effects of reducing anticholinergic burden. What are anticholinergic medicines? Medicines can be classified by their ability to block the action of a chemical signalling system in the body called the cholinergic system. A medicine that does this is said to have anticholinergic effects and therefore is referred to as an anticholinergic medicine. Sometimes the anticholinergic effect is important for the way the medicine works, and sometimes it is an unintended side effect. A lot of common medicines have some anticholinergic effect and these can add up. The total anticholinergic effect of all the medicines someone takes is called the anticholinergic burden. An older person taking one strongly anticholinergic medicine or several mildly anticholinergic medicines may have a significant anticholinergic burden. The cholinergic system in the brain plays an important role in cognition (thinking and remembering). There are concerns that a high anticholinergic burden may unintentionally cause or worsen cognitive problems, even speeding up the development of dementia or worsening the symptoms of people who already have dementia. Guidelines suggest that doctors should review the amount of anticholinergic medication prescribed to older people. What did we want to find out? In this review, we wanted to investigate interventions aimed at reducing the anticholinergic medicines prescribed to older adults. We wanted to know if these interventions were better than usual care for improving cognition and reducing diagnoses of dementia in older adults. We also wanted to know if reducing overall anticholinergic burden had any harmful effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that evaluated interventions to reduce anticholinergic burden compared with usual care in older adults. For the comparison to be fair, people had to be allocated randomly to the intervention or the usual care group. We included older people who had no cognitive problems and people who did, including those with dementia. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in their findings, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found three relevant trials that recruited a total of 299 older adults. All three trials included a mixture of people with and without cognitive problems. They were all short trials, measuring cognition just one to three months after the intervention. Only two trials were successful in reducing the overall anticholinergic burden of the intervention group. However, one of these trials reported that people in the intervention group did no better on cognitive tests than people who had usual care, and the other trial found that people in the intervention group had better scores in only one of several cognitive tests. No trials found that interventions to reduce anticholinergic burden led to any other improvements compared to usual care, and no trials investigated how safe the interventions were. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our overall confidence in the results is very low. The trials had small numbers of participants, did not study people who already had cognitive problems separately from those who did not, and had mixed success in reducing anticholinergic burden. From the available evidence, we cannot say whether interventions to reduce anticholinergic burden are safe and effective for preserving or improving cognition in older people. How up to date is this evidence? We searched for studies published up to 1 November 2022.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Dementia is a common chronic condition, mainly affecting older adults, characterised by a progressive decline in cognitive and functional abilities. Medical treatments for dementia are limited. Cannabinoids are being investigated for the treatment of dementia. Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of cannabinoids for the treatment of dementia. Search methods We searched ALOIS ‐ the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialised Register ‐ on 8 July 2021, using the terms cannabis or cannabinoid or endocannabinoid or cannabidiol or THC or CBD or dronabinol or delta‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol or marijuana or marihuana or hashish. The register contains records from all major healthcare databases (the  Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of cannabinoids for the treatment of dementia. We included participants of any age and of either sex with diagnosed dementia of any subtype, or with unspecified dementia of any severity, from any setting. We considered studies of cannabinoids administered by any route, at any dose, for any duration, compared with placebo, no treatment, or any active control intervention. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened and selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in included studies. When necessary, other review authors were involved in reaching consensus decisions. We conducted meta‐analyses using a generic inverse variance fixed‐effect model to derive estimates of effect size. We used GRADE methods to assess our confidence in the effect estimates. Main results We included four studies (126 participants) in this review. Most participants had Alzheimer's disease; a few had vascular dementia or mixed dementia. Three studies had low risk of bias across all domains; one study had unclear risk of bias for the majority of domains.  The included studies tested natural delta‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (Namisol) and two types of synthetic THC analogue (dronabinol and nabilone). Three trials had a cross‐over design. Interventions were applied over 3 to 14 weeks; one study reported adverse events over 70 weeks of follow‐up. One trial was undertaken in the USA, one in Canada, and two in The Netherlands. Two studies reported non‐commercial funding, and two studies were conducted with the support of both commercial and non‐commercial funding. Primary outcomes in this review were changes in global and specific cognitive function, overall behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and adverse events. We found very low‐certainty evidence suggesting there may be little or no clinically important effect of a synthetic THC analogue on cognition assessed with the standardised Mini‐Mental State Examination (sMMSE) (mean difference (MD) 1.1 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1 to 2.1; 1 cross‐over trial, 28 participants).  We found low‐certainty evidence suggesting there may be little or no clinically important effect of cannabinoids on overall behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (or its modified nursing home version) (MD ‐1.97, 95% CI ‐3.87 to ‐0.07; 1 parallel group and 2 cross‐over studies, 110 participants). All included studies reported data on adverse events. However, the total number of adverse events, the total numbers of mild and moderate adverse events, and the total number of serious adverse events (SAEs) were not reported in a way that permitted meta‐analysis.  There were no clear differences between groups in numbers of adverse events, with the exception of sedation (including lethargy), which was more frequent among participants taking nabilone (N = 17) than placebo (N = 6) (odds ratio (OR) 2.83, 95% CI 1.07 to 7.48; 1 cross‐over study, 38 participants). We judged the certainty of evidence for adverse event outcomes to be low or very low due to serious concerns regarding imprecision and indirectness. Authors' conclusions Based on data from four small, short, and heterogeneous placebo‐controlled trials, we cannot be certain whether cannabinoids have any beneficial or harmful effects on dementia. If there are benefits of cannabinoids for people with dementia, the effects may be too small to be clinically meaningful. Adequately powered, methodologically robust trials with longer follow‐up are needed to properly assess the effects of cannabinoids in dementia. Plain language summary Cannabinoids for the treatment of dementia Background Dementia is the name for a range of conditions associated with an ongoing loss of thinking ability, memory, and other mental abilities. Medical treatments for dementia are limited and confer modest benefits. Many medications and non‐pharmacological interventions are used for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. However,  there are continuing problems with their lack of efficacy, safety, and feasibility. Accordingly, new, safe, and more effective treatments are needed for dementia and its associated symptoms.  Our review question The cannabinoids are one potential agent under investigation for the treatment of dementia. The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate whether cannabinoids could help people with dementia, and whether they have any potential harmful effects. What we did We searched databases of scientific studies to find studies that had to randomly decide whether people would be treated with cannabinoids or a comparator. We combined the results of included studies to estimate the effects of cannabinoids. We also assessed how well these studies were conducted and how credible their results were. What we found We searched for relevant studies that had been published up to June 2020. We found four trials that met the inclusion criteria for this review. A total of 126 people were included in those four trials. Most participants had Alzheimer's disease, and a few had vascular dementia or mixed dementia. One trial was undertaken in the USA, one in Canada, and two in The Netherlands. Trials used different types of cannabinoids. Studies reported that cannabinoids have little or no effect on memory and thinking. They reported different results regarding overall behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, based on the types of individuals who were reporting data. Family caregivers did not report a beneficial effect of cannabinoids on behaviour and psychological symptoms, but nursing staff reported improvement of symptoms among participants receiving cannabinoids. Harms were reported in all studies, among both participants taking cannabinoids and those taking placebo. However, we could not combine the total number of harmful events due to problems with data reporting. There was no significant difference between participants taking cannabinoids and those given placebo in the total numbers of harmful events belonging to nervous system disorders, psychiatric disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders. Sedation (including lethargy) was more frequent in participants taking cannabinoids, but these results were uncertain. We have very low confidence in these results because studies included a small number of participants, there were differences between the studies, and their results were uncertain. Our conclusions Based on data from four small trials of short duration, it is uncertain whether cannabinoids have any beneficial or harmful effects on dementia, compared to placebo. Even if the benefit reported in these studies is real, the effect was modest and may not be important to people living with dementia. Furthermore, available studies were very short, with efficacy examined over 3 to 14 weeks, and one study did not report its methods and results completely. A large, well‐conducted study is needed to understand better if cannabinoids are a useful treatment for people living with dementia.},

ISSN = {1465-1858},
abstract = {Abstract - Background Dementia is a syndrome of acquired cognitive impairment which is severe enough to interfere with independent living. Over the course of the illness, people with dementia also experience changes in emotions, behaviour and social relationships. According to Alzheimer's Disease International, dementia affects approximately 55 million people worldwide. The latest NICE guideline for dementia highlights the value of diverse treatment options for the different stages and symptoms of dementia, including non‐pharmacological treatments. Relevant literature also argues for the value of interventions that acknowledge the complexity of the condition and address the person as a whole, including their physical, emotional, social and cognitive processes. A growing literature highlights the capacity of the arts and has embodied practices to address this complexity. Dance movement therapy (DMT) is an embodied psychological intervention that can address complexity and thus may be useful for people with dementia, but its effectiveness remains unclear. Objectives To assess the effects of dance movement therapy on behavioural, social, cognitive and emotional symptoms of people with dementia in comparison to no treatment, standard care or any other treatment. Also, to compare different forms of dance movement therapy (e.g. Laban‐based dance movement therapy, Chacian dance movement therapy or Authentic Movement) Search methods We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's meta‐register of the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal until 8 December 2022. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included people with dementia, of any age and in any setting. The DMT intervention had to be delivered by a dance movement therapy practitioner who (i) had received formal training (ii) was a dance movement therapist in training or (iii) was otherwise recognised as a dance movement therapist in the country in which the study was conducted. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and evaluated methodological quality. We expressed effect estimates using the mean difference (MD) between intervention groups and presented associated confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE methods to rate our certainty in the results. Main results We found only one study eligible for inclusion in this review. This was a 3‐arm parallel‐group RCT conducted in Hong Kong involving 204 adults with mild neurocognitive disorder or dementia. The study examined the effects of short‐term (12 weeks) group DMT in comparison with exercise and a waiting‐list control group immediately post‐intervention and three and nine months later. We found that, at the end of the intervention, DMT may result in little to no difference in neuropsychiatric symptoms assessed with the 12‐item Neuropsychiatric Inventory when compared with waiting list (MD 0.3, 95% CI ‐0.96 to 1.56; low‐certainty evidence) or exercise (MD ‐0.30, 95% CI ‐1.83 to 1.23; low‐certainty evidence). Nor was there any evidence of effects at later time points. Cognitive functioning was assessed with a variety of instruments and there were no statistically significant between‐group differences (low‐certainty evidence). When compared to exercise or waiting list, DMT may result in little to no difference in cognitive function immediately after the intervention or at follow‐up. In comparison to waiting list, DMT may result in a slight reduction in depression assessed with the 4‐item Geriatric Depression Scale at the end of therapy (MD ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐0.96 to ‐0.24; low‐certainty evidence). This slight positive effect of DMT on depression scores was sustained at three and nine months after the completion of the intervention. DMT may also reduce depression slightly in comparison with exercise at the end of therapy (MD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐0.76 to ‐0.04, low‐certainty evidence), an effect also sustained at three and nine months. Our fourth primary outcome, quality of life, was not assessed in the included study. There were data for two of our secondary outcomes, social and occupational functioning and dropouts (which we used as a proxy for acceptability), but in both cases the evidence was of very low certainty and hence our confidence in the results was very low. For all outcomes, we considered the certainty of the evidence in relation to our review objectives to be low or very low in GRADE terms due to indirectness (because not all participants in the included study had a diagnosis of dementia) and imprecision. Authors' conclusions This review included one RCT with a low risk of bias. Due to the low certainty of the evidence, the true effects of DMT as an intervention for dementia may be substantially different from those found. More RCTs are needed to determine with any confidence whether DMT has beneficial effects on dementia. Plain language summary Is dance movement therapy an effective intervention for dementia? A review of the evidence Plain language summary title Are there any benefits of dance movement therapy for people with dementia? Key messages We do not know if dance movement therapy is an effective intervention for dementia. More research is needed in this field especially regarding the impact of dance movement therapy on depression. What is dementia? Dementia affects thinking and memory and how people are able to manage daily tasks. People with dementia may also struggle to follow conversations, be confused and change moods at different times. These symptoms can affect communication, and lead to loneliness, consequently causing depression and increased stress levels. How is dementia treated? Dementia may be treated through drugs to reduce symptoms. However, there are also complex interventions that are starting to emerge that address the person as a whole. There is also a growing interest in the use of dance and other forms of the arts for people with dementia. What did we want to find out? We wanted to assess the impact of dance movement therapy on different aspects of a person's life in comparison to no treatment, standard care or any other treatment. The main outcomes we were interested in were overall problems with behaviour and mental well‐being, cognition (thinking and remembering), depression and quality of life. We also wanted to compare different forms of dance movement therapy. What did we do? We searched the literature carefully for studies which compared a group of people with dementia who had dance movement therapy with another group of people with dementia (the control group). For the comparison to be fair, the assignment of a person to a particular group had to be decided randomly. We found only one study to include in our review. The study took place in Hong Kong and involved 204 people. Some of them had mild dementia and some had even milder problems with thinking and memory. In this study, the researchers compared dance movement therapy with exercise and with a waiting list. They compared the groups at the end of the therapy and then again three and nine months later. What did we find? We did not find any difference between dance movement therapy and either exercise or waiting list for overall behaviour and mental well‐being or for cognition. For depression, we found that there may be a small beneficial effect of dance movement therapy compared with exercise or waiting list, and this effect was still present three and nine months after the end of the therapy. However, we are not sure whether or not the effect was large enough to be really noticeable to the people with dementia. The study did not measure the participants' quality of life. What are the limitations of the evidence? There was only one study, so the amount of evidence was small. The study was well‐conducted, but not all the participants had dementia (some had milder problems) and we do not know how well the results apply only to people with dementia. For these reasons, we are not certain if dance movement therapy is effective in supporting people with mild dementia and we cannot say anything about its effects in moderate or severe dementia. More studies are needed to be able to say for certain if dance movement therapy is beneficial for people with dementia of any severity. How up‐to‐date is this evidence? The last search was on 8 December 2022.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Dementia leads to progressive cognitive decline, and represents a significant health and societal burden. Its prevalence is growing, with Alzheimer's disease as the leading cause. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but there are regulatory‐approved pharmacological interventions, such as galantamine, for symptomatic relief. This review updates the 2006 version. Objectives To assess the clinical effects, including adverse effects, of galantamine in people with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment, and to investigate potential moderators of effect. Search methods We systematically searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register on 14 December 2022 using the term 'galantamine'. The Register contains records of clinical trials identified from major electronic databases (including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase), trial registries, grey literature sources, and conference proceedings. We manually searched reference lists and collected information from US Food and Drug Administration documents and unpublished trial reports. We imposed no language restrictions. Selection criteria We included double‐blind, parallel‐group, randomised controlled trials comparing oral galantamine with placebo for a treatment duration exceeding four weeks in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or with mild cognitive impairment. Data collection and analysis Working independently, two review authors selected studies for inclusion, assessed their quality, and extracted data. Outcomes of interest included cognitive function, change in global function, activities of daily living, functional disability, behavioural function, and adverse events. We used a fixed‐effect model for meta‐analytic synthesis, and presented results as Peto odds ratios (OR) or weighted mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals. We used Cochrane's original risk of bias tool (RoB 1) to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. Main results We included 21 studies with a total of 10,990 participants. The average age of participants was 74 years, and 37% were male. The studies' durations ranged from eight weeks to two years, with 24 weeks being the most common duration. One newly included study assessed the effects of galantamine at two years, and another newly included study involved participants with severe Alzheimer's disease. Nineteen studies with 10,497 participants contributed data to the meta‐analysis. All studies had low to unclear risk of bias for randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding. We judged four studies to be at high risk of bias due to attrition and two due to selective outcome reporting. Galantamine for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease We summarise only the results for galantamine given at 8 to 12 mg twice daily (total galantamine 16 mg to 24 mg/day), assessed at six months. See the full review for results of other dosing regimens and assessment time points. There is high‐certainty evidence that, compared to placebo, galantamine improves: cognitive function, as assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale (ADAS‐cog) (MD‐2.86, 95% CI ‐3.29 to ‐2.43; 6 studies, 3049 participants; minimum clinically important effect (MCID) = 2.6‐ to 4‐point change); functional disability, as assessed with the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) scale (MD 2.12, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.49; 3 studies, 1275 participants); and behavioural function, as assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (MD ‐1.63, 95% CI ‐3.07 to ‐0.20; 2 studies, 1043 participants) at six months. Galantamine may improve global function at six months, as assessed with the Clinician's Interview‐Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC‐plus) (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.84; 6 studies, 3002 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Participants who received galantamine were more likely than placebo‐treated participants to discontinue prematurely (22.7% versus 17.2%) (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.68; 6 studies, 3336 participants; high‐certainty evidence), and experience nausea (20.9% versus 8.4%) (OR 2.89, 95% CI 2.40 to 3.49; 7 studies, 3616 participants; high‐certainty evidence) during the studies. Galantamine reduced death rates at six months: 1.3% of participants in the galantamine groups had died compared to 2.3% in the placebo groups (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.96; 6 studies, 3493 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Galantamine for mild cognitive impairment We summarise results, assessed at two years, from two studies that gave participants galantamine at 8 to 12 mg twice daily (total galantamine 16 mg to 24 mg/day). Compared to placebo, galantamine may not improve cognitive function, as assessed with the expanded ADAS‐cog for mild cognitive impairment (MD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.78 to 0.37; 2 studies, 1901 participants; low‐certainty evidence) or activities of daily living, assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily Living scale for mild cognitive impairment (MD 0.30, 95% CI ‐0.26 to 0.86; 2 studies, 1901 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Participants who received galantamine were probably more likely to discontinue prematurely than placebo‐treated participants (40.7% versus 28.6%) (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.05; 2 studies, 2057 participants) and to experience nausea (29.4% versus 10.7%) (OR 3.49, 95% CI 2.75 to 4.44; 2 studies, 2057 participants), both with moderate‐certainty evidence. Galantamine may not reduce death rates at 24 months compared to placebo (0.5% versus 0.1%) (OR 5.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 29.10; 2 studies, 2057 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Results from subgroup analysis and meta‐regression suggest that an imbalance in discontinuation rates between galantamine and placebo groups, together with the use of the 'last observation carried forward' approach to outcome assessment, may potentially bias cognitive outcomes in favour of galantamine. Authors' conclusions Compared to placebo, galantamine (when given at a total dose of 16 mg to 24 mg/day) slows the decline in cognitive function, functional ability, and behaviour at six months in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine probably also slows declines in global function at six months. The changes observed in cognition, assessed with the ADAS‐cog scale, were clinically meaningful. Gastrointestinal‐related adverse events are the primary concerns associated with galantamine use in people with dementia, which may limit its tolerability. Although death rates were generally low, participants in the galantamine groups had a reduced risk of death compared to those in the placebo groups. There is no evidence to support the use of galantamine in people with mild cognitive impairment. Plain language summary Does galantamine help people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and people with mild cognitive impairment? Key messages For people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, galantamine (at recommended doses of 16 mg to 24 mg daily) slows a decline in memory and the ability to do self‐care activities at 6 months and 2 years after treatment. For people with mild cognitive impairment, there is no difference in the improvement in memory or the ability to do self‐care activities when comparing galantamine and placebo (an inactive or 'dummy' medicine). Galantamine caused a higher number of unwanted effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), but made no difference in death from any cause when compared to placebo. Background Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia among older people that causes problems with memory, thinking, and behaviour. The disease worsens over time to the extent that it affects a person's ability to carry out day‐to‐day tasks. For people with mild cognitive impairment, symptoms affecting thinking and memory are mild and usually not serious enough to interfere with daily life and activities. Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but medications that can help with symptoms are available. Galantamine is one of the three cholinesterase inhibitor medications approved by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine works by increasing the levels of a chemical in the brain, acetylcholine, that transmits signals, which may help with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. There are no medications currently approved by regulatory bodies as treatments for mild cognitive impairment. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether galantamine is effective and helpful in improving the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, in terms of memory, ability to carry out self‐care, and behaviour. We also wanted to find out if galantamine causes any unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared galantamine given by mouth to placebo (which does not contain any active ingredients but is given in the same way as the active medication) in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, or with mild cognitive impairment. We chose studies in which people were assigned randomly (like a flip of a coin) to receive galantamine or placebo for at least 4 weeks. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 21 studies that involved 10,990 people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, or with mild cognitive impairment. Their average age was 74 years. Treatment durations ranged from 8 weeks to 2 years. Most studies included people with dementia due to mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease; one study involved people with severe Alzheimer's disease. Three studies included people with mild cognitive impairment. Pharmaceutical companies (Janssen / Johnson & Johnson) sponsored 16 of the 21 included studies. After 6 months of treatment, participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who received galantamine had better memory, ability to do self‐care activities, and behaviour than those who received placebo. Importantly, the memory improvements we observed were considered clinically meaningful according to standards set by experts. This same group of participants probably had better overall improvement than those who received placebo. In people with mild cognitive impairment, galantamine, compared to placebo, may make little to no difference in improving memory or the ability to do self‐care activities. However, participants who received galantamine probably had a lower risk of progression to dementia after 2 years of treatment. Compared to those taking placebo, people on galantamine were three times more likely to experience gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). The number of deaths was low, and there was no evidence that galantamine caused more deaths than placebo. What are the limitations of the evidence? Many people in the studies (ranging from 17% to 40%) stopped taking their assigned medication early, more so in the galantamine groups than the placebo groups. This is a limitation which may favour galantamine. How current is this evidence? This review updates our previous review from 2006. The evidence is current to December 2022.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega‐3 PUFAs) from fish and plant sources are commonly considered as a promising non‐medical alternative to improve brain functions and slow down the progression of dementia. This assumption is mostly based on findings of preclinical studies and epidemiological research. Resulting explanatory models aim at the role omega‐3 PUFAs play in the development and integrity of the brain's neurons, their protective antioxidative effect on cell membranes and potential neurochemical mechanisms directly related to Alzheimer‐specific pathology. Epidemiological research also found evidence of malnutrition in people with dementia. Considering this and the fact that omega‐3 PUFA cannot be synthesised by humans, omega‐3 PUFAs might be a promising treatment option for dementia. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation for the treatment of people with dementia. Search methods We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) portal/ICTRP on 10 December 2015. We contacted manufacturers of omega‐3 supplements and scanned reference lists of landmark papers and included articles. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which omega‐3 PUFA in the form of supplements or enriched diets were administered to people with Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Data collection and analysis The primary outcome measures of interest were changes in global and specific cognitive functions, functional performance, dementia severity and adverse effects. Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the quality of trials according to the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We received unpublished data from the trial authors and collected adverse effects information from the published articles. We conducted meta‐analyses for available outcome measures at six months. Main results We included three comparable randomised, placebo‐controlled trials investigating omega‐3 PUFA supplements in 632 participants with mild to moderate AD over six, 12 and 18 months. We found no studies investigating other types of dementia. All trials were of high methodological quality. The overall quality of evidence for most of the outcomes was high. There was no evidence of a benefit from omega‐3 PUFAs on cognitive function when measured at six months with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale ‐ Cognitive subscale (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.19 to 0.15; 566 participants; 3 studies; high quality evidence) or Mini‐Mental State Examination (mean difference (MD) 0.18, 95% CI ‐1.05 to 1.41; 202 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) or on activities of daily living (SMD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.16; 544 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence). There was also no effect at six months of treatment on severity of dementia measured with the Clinical Dementia Rating ‐ Sum of Boxes (MD ‐0.00, 95% CI ‐0.58 to 0.57; 542 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) or on quality of life measured with the Quality of Life Alzheimer's Disease scale (MD ‐0.10, 95% CI ‐1.28 to 1.08; 322 participants; 1 study; high quality evidence). There was no difference at six months on mental health measured with the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MD ‐0.10, 95% CI ‐0.74 to 0.54; 178 participants: 1 study; high quality of evidence) or the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (SMD 0.10, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.27; 543 participants; 2 studies; high quality of evidence). One very small study showed a benefit for omega‐3 PUFAs in instrumental activities of daily living after 12 months of treatment (MD ‐3.50, 95% CI ‐4.30 to ‐2.70; 22 participants; moderate quality evidence). The included studies did not measure specific cognitive function. The studies did not report adverse events well. Two studies stated that all adverse events were mild and that they did not differ in overall frequency between omega‐3 PUFA and placebo groups. Data from one study showed no difference between groups in frequency of any adverse event (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10; 402 participants; 1 study; moderate quality evidence) or any serious adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.41; 402 participants; 1 study; high quality evidence) at 18 months of treatment. Authors' conclusions We found no convincing evidence for the efficacy of omega‐3 PUFA supplements in the treatment of mild to moderate AD. This result was consistent for all outcomes relevant for people with dementia. Adverse effects of omega‐3 PUFAs seemed to be low, but based on the evidence synthesised in this review, we cannot make a final statement on tolerability. The effects on other populations remain unclear. Plain language summary Omega‐3 fatty acids for the treatment of dementia Background Omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega‐3 PUFAs) are assumed to have a beneficial effect on the function of the brain. It has been suggested that they might improve or delay decline in memory and ability to carry out everyday tasks in people with dementia. In this review, we investigated randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing omega‐3 PUFAs, given in the form of supplements or enriched diets, with placebo (a pretend treatment) in people with the most common types of dementia. Included trials We included three trials that investigated 632 people with Alzheimer's disease of mild to moderate severity. We found no trials on other types of dementia. In all trials participants took either placebo or omega‐3 PUFA supplements. The quality of the trials was good. The participants were allocated to the groups randomly. The participants and most of the investigators did not know which treatment was given. Results When we combined the results of the trials, we found that taking omega‐3 PUFA supplements for six months had no effect on cognition (learning and understanding), everyday functioning, quality of life or mental health. One very small study observed that omega‐3 PUFAs improved cognitively complex daily activities, such as shopping, when taken for a longer period of time. However, the quality of the evidence was only moderate, so this should be confirmed in further trials. Omega‐3 PUFAs also had no effect on ratings of the overall severity of the illness. The trials did not report side effects very well, but none of the studies reported significant harmful effects on health. Conclusion Altogether, the quality of the evidence was moderate or high for most of the effects that we measured, but we found no evidence for either benefit or harm from omega‐3 PUFA supplements in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The effects on people with other types of dementia remain unclear.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are becoming increasingly common with the aging of most populations. The majority of individuals with dementia will first present for care and assessment in primary care settings. There is a need for brief dementia screening instruments that can accurately detect dementia in primary care settings. The Mini‐Cog is a brief, cognitive screening test that is frequently used to evaluate cognition in older adults in various settings. Objectives To determine the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog for detecting dementia in a primary care setting. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies, MEDLINE, Embase and four other databases, initially to September 2012. Since then, four updates to the search were performed using the same search methods, and the most recent was January 2017. We used citation tracking (using the databases' ‘related articles’ feature, where available) as an additional search method and contacted authors of eligible studies for unpublished data. Selection criteria We only included studies that evaluated the Mini‐Cog as an index test for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia or related forms of dementia when compared to a reference standard using validated criteria for dementia. We only included studies that were conducted in primary care populations. Data collection and analysis We extracted and described information on the characteristics of the study participants and study setting. Using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) criteria we evaluated the quality of studies, and we assessed risk of bias and applicability of each study for each domain in QUADAS‐2. Two review authors independently extracted information on the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives and entered the data into Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5). We then used RevMan 5 to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence intervals. We summarized the sensitivity and specificity of the Mini‐Cog in the individual studies in forest plots and also plotted them in a receiver operating characteristic plot. We also created a 'Risk of bias' and applicability concerns graph to summarize information related to the quality of included studies. Main results There were a total of four studies that met our inclusion criteria, including a total of 1517 total participants. The sensitivity of the Mini‐Cog varied between 0.76 to 1.00 in studies while the specificity varied between 0.27 to 0.85. The included studies displayed significant heterogeneity in both methodologies and clinical populations, which did not allow for a meta‐analysis to be completed. Only one study (Holsinger 2012) was found to be at low risk of bias on all methodological domains. The results of this study reported that the sensitivity of the Mini‐Cog was 0.76 and the specificity was 0.73. We found the quality of all other included studies to be low due to a high risk of bias with methodological limitations primarily in their selection of participants. Authors' conclusions There is a limited number of studies evaluating the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog for the diagnosis of dementia in primary care settings. Given the small number of studies, the wide range in estimates of the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog, and methodological limitations identified in most of the studies, at the present time there is insufficient evidence to recommend that the Mini‐Cog be used as a screening test for dementia in primary care. Further studies are required to determine the accuracy of Mini‐Cog in primary care and whether this tool has sufficient diagnostic test accuracy to be useful as a screening test in this setting. Plain language summary How accurate is the mini‐cog test when used to assess dementia in general practice? Background and rationale for review In most parts of the world there are increasing numbers of older adults, and memory complaints and conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are becoming increasingly common as a result. Most individuals with memory difficulties will first seek out care or be identified in the healthcare system through their primary care health care providers, which may include family physicians or nurses. Therefore, there is a need for tools that could identify individuals who may have dementia or significant memory problems. These tools should also be able to rule out dementia in those individuals with memory complaints who do not have dementia or significant memory problems. Such tools in primary care must be relatively easy to use, quick to administer, and accurate so as to be feasible to use in primary care while at the same time not overdiagnose or underdiagnose dementia. The Mini‐Cog, a brief cognitive screening tool, has been suggested as a possible screening test for dementia in primary care as it has been reported to be accurate and relatively easy to administer in primary care settings. The Mini‐Cog consists of a memory task that involves recall of three words and an evaluation of a clock drawing task. Study characteristics We searched electronic databases for articles evaluating the Mini‐Cog and this evidence is current as of January 2017. The purpose of our review was to compare the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog for detecting dementia of any type in primary care settings when compared to in‐depth evaluation conducted by dementia specialists. We included studies that evaluated individuals with any potential severity of dementia and regardless of whether previous cognitive testing had been completed prior to the Mini‐Cog. Overall, our review identified four studies conducted in primary care settings that compared the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog to detailed assessment of dementia by dementia specialists. Quality of the evidence Of the four studies included in the review, all except one study had limitations in how the Mini‐Cog was evaluated, which may have led to an overestimation of the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog in the remaining studies. Notably, the most problematic issue in study quality related to how participants were selected to participate in research studies, which may have further contributed to an overestimation of the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog in most of the studies included in our review. Key findings The results of the highest‐quality study Holsinger 2012 found that the Mini‐Cog had a sensitivity of 76%, indicating that the Mini‐Cog failed to detect up to 24% of individuals who have dementia (e.g. false negatives). In this same study, the specificity of the Mini‐Cog was 73% indicating that up to 27% of individuals may be incorrectly identified as having dementia on the Mini‐Cog when these individuals do not actually have an underlying dementia (e.g. false positives). We conclude that at the present time there is not enough evidence to support the routine use of the Mini‐Cog as a screening test for dementia in primary care and additional studies are required before concluding that the Mini‐Cog is useful in this setting.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and then updated in 2009. Vascular risk factors including high cholesterol levels increase the risk of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and of vascular dementia. Some observational studies have suggested an association between statin use and lowered incidence of dementia. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins for the prevention of dementia in people at risk of dementia due to their age and to determine whether the efficacy and safety of statins for this purpose depends on cholesterol level, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype or cognitive level. Search methods We searched ALOIS (the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group),  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal on 11 November 2015. Selection criteria We included double‐blind, randomised, placebo‐controlled trials in which statins were administered for at least 12 months to people at risk of dementia. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included two trials with 26,340 participants aged 40 to 82 years of whom 11,610 were aged 70 or older. All participants had a history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease. The studies used different statins (simvastatin and pravastatin). Mean follow‐up was 3.2 years in one study and five years in one study. The risk of bias was low. Only one study reported on the incidence of dementia (20,536 participants, 31 cases in each group; odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.65, moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to imprecision). Both studies assessed cognitive function, but at different times using different scales, so we judged the results unsuitable for a meta‐analysis. There were no differences between statin and placebo groups on five different cognitive tests (high quality evidence). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to non‐fatal adverse events were less than 5% in both studies and there was no difference between statin and placebo groups in the risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (26,340 participants, 2 studies, OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05). Authors' conclusions There is good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia. Biologically, it seems feasible that statins could prevent dementia due to their role in cholesterol reduction and initial evidence from observational studies was very promising. However, indication bias may have been a factor in these studies and the evidence from subsequent RCTs has been negative. There were limitations in the included studies involving the cognitive assessments used and the inclusion of participants at moderate to high vascular risk only. Plain language summary Statins for the prevention of dementia Background Dementia (including Alzheimer's disease) is a global healthcare concern; the number of people affected worldwide is predicted to double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2010 and 131.5 million in 2050. Therefore, it is important to find means of preventing dementia. It has been suggested that high levels of cholesterol in the serum (part of the blood) may increase the risk of dementia and that treatment with cholesterol‐lowering medicines such as statins may reduce the risk of dementia. Study characteristics We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing giving a statin to giving a placebo (pretend medicine) to people with normal cognitive function (which is brain activities that allow us to gain and use knowledge) and of sufficient age to be at risk of Alzheimer's disease. Key results We found two suitable randomised trials for inclusion in this review with 26,340 participants; neither showed any reduction in occurrence of Alzheimer's disease or dementia in people treated with statins compared to people given placebo. Side effects were low in both statin and placebo groups with no difference between groups in the risk of dropping out of the trial due to side effects. Quality of the evidence There were limitations in the included studies involving the methods of assessment of cognition and the inclusion only of participants deemed to be of moderate to high risk of a problem with their blood (vascular) system. Nevertheless, there was good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006 (McGuinness 2006), and previously updated in 2009 (McGuinness 2009). Hypertension is a risk factor for dementia. Observational studies suggest antihypertensive treatment is associated with lower incidences of cognitive impairment and dementia. There is already clear evidence to support the treatment of hypertension after stroke. Objectives To assess whether pharmacological treatment of hypertension can prevent cognitive impairment or dementia in people who have no history of cerebrovascular disease. Search methods We searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, as well as many trials registries and grey literature sources, most recently on 7 July 2020. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which pharmacological interventions to treat hypertension were given for at least 12 months. We excluded trials of pharmacological interventions to lower blood pressure in non‐hypertensive participants. We also excluded trials conducted solely in people with stroke. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected information regarding incidence of dementia, cognitive decline, change in blood pressure, adverse effects and quality of life. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Main results We included 12 studies, totaling 30,412 participants, in this review. Eight studies compared active treatment with placebo. Of the four non‐placebo‐controlled studies, two compared intensive versus standard blood pressure reduction. The two final included studies compared different classes of antihypertensive drug. Study durations varied from one to five years. The combined result of four placebo‐controlled trials that reported incident dementia indicated no evidence of a difference in the risk of dementia between the antihypertensive treatment group and the placebo group (236/7767 versus 259/7660, odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.09; very low certainty evidence, downgraded due to study limitations and indirectness). The combined results from five placebo‐controlled trials that reported change in Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) may indicate a modest benefit from antihypertensive treatment (mean difference (MD) 0.20, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.29; very low certainty evidence, downgraded due to study limitations, indirectness and imprecision). The certainty of evidence for both cognitive outcomes was downgraded on the basis of study limitations and indirectness. Study durations were too short, overall, to expect a significant difference in dementia rates between groups. Dementia and cognitive decline were secondary outcomes for most studies. Additional sources of bias include: the use of antihypertensive medication by the placebo group in the placebo‐controlled trials; failure to reach recruitment targets; and early termination of studies on safety grounds. Meta‐analysis of the placebo‐controlled trials reporting results found a mean change in systolic blood pressure of ‐9.25 mmHg (95% CI ‐9.73, ‐8.78) between treatment (n = 8973) and placebo (n = 8820) groups, and a mean change in diastolic blood pressure of ‐2.47 mmHg (95% CI ‐2.70, ‐2.24) between treatment (n = 7700) and placebo (n = 7509) groups (both low certainty evidence downgraded on the basis of study limitations and inconsistency). Three trials ‐ SHEP 1991, LOMIR MCT IL 1996 and MRC 1996 ‐ reported more withdrawals due to adverse events in active treatment groups than placebo groups. Participants on active treatment in Syst Eur 1998 were less likely to discontinue treatment due to side effects, and participants on active treatment in HYVET 2008 reported fewer 'serious adverse events' than in the placebo group. There was no evidence of a difference in withdrawals rates between groups in SCOPE 2003, and results were unclear for Perez Stable 2000 and Zhang 2018. Heterogeneity precluded meta‐analysis. Five of the placebo‐controlled trials provided quality of life (QOL) data. Heterogeneity again precluded meta‐analysis. SHEP 1991, Syst Eur 1998 and HYVET 2008 reported no evidence of a difference in QOL measures between active treatment and placebo groups over time. The SCOPE 2003 sub‐study (Degl'Innocenti 2004) showed a smaller drop in QOL measures in the active treatment compared to the placebo group. LOMIR MCT IL 1996 reported an improvement in a QOL measure at twelve months in one active treatment group and deterioration in another. Authors' conclusions High certainty randomised controlled trial evidence regarding the effect of hypertension treatment on dementia and cognitive decline does not yet exist. The studies included in this review provide low certainty evidence (downgraded primarily due to study limitations and indirectness) that pharmacological treatment of hypertension, in people without prior cerebrovascular disease, leads to less cognitive decline compared to controls. This difference is below the level considered clinically significant. The studies included in this review also provide very low certainty evidence that pharmacological treatment of hypertension, in people without prior cerebrovascular disease, prevents dementia. Plain language summary Treating high blood pressure with medicines to prevent future dementia or problems with memory and thinking Why this review is important Observational studies following participants over many years have suggested that high blood pressure is associated with subsequent dementia or new problems with memory and thinking (cognitive impairment). It is important to establish if treating high blood pressure can reduce the risk of dementia and problems with memory and thinking. There is already clear evidence to support the treatment of high blood pressure after stroke. The evidence for treating high blood pressure in the absence of stroke was not as well established when this review protocol was written. Main findings of the review We included 12 trials, with a total of 30,412 participants, in this review. Treating high blood pressure with medicines may reduce the risk of dementia and problems with memory and thinking, but we were unable to confirm this using the data we have available. This may be due to shortcomings in the evidence available. Some participants had side effects from medications, such as falls, that led to them stopping the medications. This is also an important consideration. Limitations of the review We were unable to find evidence to confirm that treating high blood pressure with medicines will prevent future dementia or problems with memory and thinking. Based on the evidence available, all we can say is that the methods used in the studies we looked at were not sufficient to answer our study question. In practice, we want to know if treating high blood pressure in mid‐life reduces dementia and problems with memory and thinking in later life. These studies were too short in duration to answer this question. They tended to be designed to investigate heart attack and stroke as outcome measures, with memory and thinking tests added on, which means they were less likely to include the numbers of people with problems with memory and thinking necessary to reliably answer the question. In the studies comparing active medicines and placebo (inactive medicine), many people in the placebo groups ultimately did receive active medicine which further complicated the results. Antihypertensive treatment may prevent new problems with memory and thinking, or dementia, or both, despite the findings of this review. To be more confident in our conclusions, we would need studies that have more distinct treatment and placebo groups, and that treat participants starting at a younger age and with a longer follow‐up.},

Certain findings on brain PET scans can potentially predict the decline of mild cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other dementias. Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the ¹⁸F‐FDG PET index test for detecting people with MCI at baseline who would clinically convert to Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other forms of dementia at follow‐up. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, PsycINFO, BIOSIS previews, LILACS, MEDION, (Meta‐analyses van Diagnostisch Onderzoek), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), HTA (Health Technology Assessment Database), ARIF (Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility) and C‐EBLM (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine Committee for Evidence‐based Laboratory Medicine) databases to January 2013. We checked the reference lists of any relevant studies and systematic reviews for additional studies. Selection criteria We included studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of ¹⁸F‐FDG PET to determine the conversion from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia or to other forms of dementia, i.e. any or all of vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and fronto‐temporal dementia. These studies necessarily employ delayed verification of conversion to dementia and are sometimes labelled as ‘delayed verification cross‐sectional studies’. Data collection and analysis Two blinded review authors independently extracted data, resolving disagreement by discussion, with the option to involve a third review author as arbiter if necessary. We extracted and summarised graphically the data for two‐by‐two tables. We conducted exploratory analyses by plotting estimates of sensitivity and specificity from each study on forest plots and in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space. When studies had mixed thresholds, we derived estimates of sensitivity and likelihood ratios at fixed values (lower quartile, median and upper quartile) of specificity from the hierarchical summary ROC (HSROC) models. Main results We included 14 studies (421 participants) in the analysis. The sensitivities for conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease dementia were between 25% and 100% while the specificities were between 15% and 100%. From the summary ROC curve we fitted we estimated that the sensitivity was 76% (95% confidence interval (CI): 53.8 to 89.7) at the included study median specificity of 82%. This equates to a positive likelihood ratio of 4.03 (95% CI: 2.97 to 5.47), and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.34 (95% CI: 0.15 to 0.75). Three studies recruited participants from the same Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort but only the largest ADNI study ( Herholz 2011 ) is included in the meta‐analysis. In order to demonstrate whether the choice of ADNI study or discriminating brain region ( Chételat 2003 ) or reader assessment ( Pardo 2010 ) make a difference to the pooled estimate, we performed five additional analyses. At the median specificity of 82%, the estimated sensitivity was between 74% and 76%. There was no impact on our findings. In addition to evaluating Alzheimer's disease dementia, five studies evaluated the accuracy of ¹⁸F‐FDG PET for all types of dementia. The sensitivities were between 46% and 95% while the specificities were between 29% and 100%; however, we did not conduct a meta‐analysis because of too few studies, and those studies which we had found recruited small numbers of participants. Our findings are based on studies with poor reporting, and the majority of included studies had an unclear risk of bias, mainly for the reference standard and participant selection domains. According to the assessment of Index test domain, more than 50% of studies were of poor methodological quality. Authors' conclusions It is difficult to determine to what extent the findings from the meta‐analysis can be applied to clinical practice. Given the considerable variability of specificity values and lack of defined thresholds for determination of test positivity in the included studies, the current evidence does not support the routine use of ¹⁸F‐FDG PET scans in clinical practice in people with MCI. The ¹⁸F‐FDG PET scan is a high‐cost investigation, and it is therefore important to clearly demonstrate its accuracy and to standardise the process of ¹⁸F‐FDG PET diagnostic modality prior to its being widely used. Future studies with more uniform approaches to thresholds, analysis and study conduct may provide a more homogeneous estimate than the one available from the included studies we have identified. Plain language summary ¹⁸F‐FDG PET scan for early prediction of developing Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) Background The numbers of people with dementia and other cognitive problems are increasing globally. A diagnosis of dementia at early stage is recommended but there is no agreement on the best approach. A range of tests have been developed which healthcare professionals can use to assess people with poor memory or cognitive impairment. In this review we have focused on the ¹⁸F‐FDG PET test. Aim We aimed to see how accurately the ¹⁸F‐FDG PET scan identified those people with MCI who would clinically convert to Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other types of dementia over a period of time. Study characteristics The evidence is current to January 2013. We included 16 studies covering 697 participants with MCI. The studies have been published over a 14‐year period (1999 to 2013). Study sizes were small and ranged from 19 to 94 participants. Five papers have a mean age of less than 70 years. The age range in the youngest sample was 55 to 73 years and in the oldest sample was 71 to 86 years. Participants were mainly recruited from university departments, clinics or research centres. The percentage of participants with positive ¹⁸F‐FDG PET scans at baseline ranged in the included studies from 10.5% to 74% and the percentage of those participants who converted to Alzheimer’s disease dementia over a period of time ranged from 22% to 50%. Included studies reported a range of different cut‐off values used for identifying their participants with positive ¹⁸F‐FDG PET scans. Quality of the evidence Our findings are based on studies with poor reporting. The majority of included studies had an unclear risk of bias, mainly because they did not describe in sufficient details how participants were selected and how the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease dementia was justified. According to the assessment of the ¹⁸F‐FDG PET test domain, more than 50% of studies were of poor methodological quality. The main limitations of the review are poor reporting in the included studies, a lack of a widely‐accepted cut‐off value of the ¹⁸F‐FDG PET scan in people with MCI, and the marked variation in test accuracy between the included studies. Key findings In this review, we have found that the ¹⁸F‐FDG PET scan, as a single test, lacks the accuracy to identify those people with MCI who would develop Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other forms of dementia over a period of time. Assuming a typical conversion rate of MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia of 38%, the findings indicate that for every 1000 ¹⁸F‐FDG PET scans, 174 cases with a negative scan will progress to Alzheimer's disease dementia and 285 with a positive scan will not. Therefore, a positive ¹⁸F‐FDG PET scan in people with MCI is of no clinical value in early prediction of developing Alzheimer's disease dementia.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Dementia is a progressive syndrome characterised by deterioration in memory, thinking and behaviour, and by impaired ability to perform daily activities. Two classes of drug ‐ cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine) and memantine ‐ are widely licensed for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, and rivastigmine is also licensed for Parkinson's disease dementia. These drugs are prescribed to alleviate symptoms and delay disease progression in these and sometimes in other forms of dementia. There are uncertainties about the benefits and adverse effects of these drugs in the long term and in severe dementia, about effects of withdrawal, and about the most appropriate time to discontinue treatment. Objectives To evaluate the effects of withdrawal or continuation of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine, or both, in people with dementia on: cognitive, neuropsychiatric and functional outcomes, rates of institutionalisation, adverse events, dropout from trials, mortality, quality of life and carer‐related outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialised Register up to 17 October 2020 using terms appropriate for the retrieval of studies of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine. The Specialised Register contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases, numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. Selection criteria We included all randomised, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) which compared withdrawal of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine, or both, with continuation of the same drug or drugs. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed citations and full‐text articles for inclusion, extracted data from included trials and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Where trials were sufficiently similar, we pooled data for outcomes in the short term (up to 2 months after randomisation), medium term (3‐11 months) and long term (12 months or more).  We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE methods. Main results We included six trials investigating cholinesterase inhibitor withdrawal, and one trial investigating withdrawal of either donepezil or memantine. No trials assessed withdrawal of memantine only. Drugs were withdrawn abruptly in five trials and stepwise in two trials. All participants had dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, with severities ranging from mild to very severe, and were taking cholinesterase inhibitors without known adverse effects at baseline. The included trials randomised 759 participants to treatment groups relevant to this review. Study duration ranged from 6 weeks to 12 months.  There were too few included studies to allow planned subgroup analyses. We considered some studies to be at unclear or high risk of selection, performance, detection, attrition or reporting bias. Compared to continuing cholinesterase inhibitors, discontinuing treatment may be associated with worse cognitive function in the short term (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.64 to ‐0.21; 4 studies; low certainty), but the effect in the medium term is very uncertain (SMD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐0.87 to 0.07; 3 studies; very low certainty). In a sensitivity analysis omitting data from a study which only included participants who had shown a relatively poor prior response to donepezil, inconsistency was reduced and we found that cognitive function may be worse in the discontinuation group in the medium term (SMD ‐0.62; 95% CI ‐0.94 to ‐0.31). Data from one longer‐term study suggest that discontinuing a cholinesterase inhibitor is probably associated with worse cognitive function at 12 months (mean difference (MD) ‐2.09 Standardised Mini‐Mental State Examination (SMMSE) points, 95% CI ‐3.43 to ‐0.75; moderate certainty). Discontinuation may make little or no difference to functional status in the short term (SMD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.54 to 0.04; 2 studies; low certainty), and its effect in the medium term is uncertain (SMD ‐0.38, 95% CI ‐0.74 to ‐0.01; 2 studies; very low certainty). After 12 months, discontinuing a cholinesterase inhibitor probably results in greater functional impairment than continuing treatment (MD ‐3.38 Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS) points, 95% CI ‐6.67 to ‐0.10; one study; moderate certainty). Discontinuation may be associated with a worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms over the short term and medium term, although we cannot exclude a minimal effect (SMD ‐ 0.48, 95% CI ‐0.82 to ‐0.13; 2 studies; low certainty; and SMD ‐0.27, 95% CI ‐0.47 to ‐0.08; 3 studies; low certainty, respectively). Data from one study suggest that discontinuing a cholinesterase inhibitor may result in little to no change in neuropsychiatric status at 12 months (MD ‐0.87 Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) points; 95% CI ‐8.42 to 6.68; moderate certainty). We found no clear evidence of an effect of discontinuation on dropout due to lack of medication efficacy or deterioration in overall medical condition (odds ratio (OR) 1.53, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.76; 4 studies; low certainty), on number of adverse events (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.27; 4 studies; low certainty) or serious adverse events (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.39; 4 studies; low certainty), and on mortality (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.55; 5 studies; low certainty). Institutionalisation was reported in one trial, but it was not possible to extract data for the groups relevant to this review. Authors' conclusions This review suggests that  discontinuing cholinesterase inhibitors may result in worse cognitive, neuropsychiatric and functional status than continuing treatment, although this is supported by limited evidence, almost all of low or very low certainty. As all participants had dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, our findings are not transferable to other dementia types. We were unable to determine whether the effects of discontinuing cholinesterase inhibitors differed with baseline dementia severity. There is currently no evidence to guide decisions about discontinuing memantine. There is a need for further well‐designed RCTs, across a range of dementia severities and settings. We are aware of two ongoing registered trials. In making decisions about discontinuing these drugs, clinicians should exercise caution, considering the evidence from existing trials along with other factors important to patients and their carers. Plain language summary Stopping or continuing anti‐dementia drugs in patients with dementia Background Dementia is the term used to describe a group of illnesses, usually developing in late life, in which there is a deterioration in a person’s ability to think, remember, communicate and manage daily activities independently. It can be caused by several different brain diseases, but the most common form is dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. At the moment, there are no medical treatments which can prevent dementia or stop it from progressing, but there are two classes of drugs – the cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) and memantine ‐ which are approved and widely prescribed to treat some of the symptoms. They are used mainly for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease but also sometimes for other types of dementia. Most of the trials studying the effects of these drugs have been quite short (typically six months) even though dementia usually lasts for years. The drugs can have unwanted side effects in some people. There is uncertainty about their long‐term effects and about how useful they are for severe dementia, with different countries making different recommendations. Therefore it can be difficult for doctors and patients to decide if and when these drugs should be stopped once they have been started. What was the aim of this review? In this review, we aimed to summarise the best evidence about whether stopping cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine was beneficial or harmful to people with dementia who had been taking them for at least two months. What we did We searched up to October 2020 for trials which had: recruited people with dementia who were taking a cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine, or both; divided them randomly into a group of patients who continued treatment and a group of patients who stopped treatment; and compared what happened in the two groups. What we found We found seven trials (759 participants) to include in the review. All of the participants had dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease, but in some trials, the disease was mild to moderate and in others, it was moderate to severe or very severe. Six trials investigated the effects of stopping a cholinesterase inhibitor and one trial investigated stopping either a cholinesterase inhibitor (specifically, donepezil) or memantine. We decided not to pool its results with the other six trials. Effects were measured over different periods of time in different trials. We looked separately at effects in the first 2 months (short term), between 3 and 11 months (medium term), and after a year or more (long term). When we looked at the effect on thinking skills and memory, we found that, compared to stopping treatment, continuing treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor may be beneficial in the short term and medium term and is probably beneficial in the long term. For ability to carry out daily activities, there may be little or no effect in the short term, and the effect in the medium term was very uncertain, but there is probably a benefit to continuing treatment over the longer term. For mood and behavioural problems, continuing treatment may have benefits in the short term and medium term, but not in the long term. We found no clear evidence about the effects of stopping these drugs on patients’ physical health or risk of dying. There was very little evidence about effects on quality of life or on the likelihood of moving to a care home to live. There was not enough evidence for us to see whether results differed with the severity of dementia. Our certainty in the results varied from moderate to very low, mainly because of small numbers of trials and participants, some problems with the way the trials were conducted, and imprecise statistical results. Our conclusions Although there was uncertainty about the results, most of the evidence pointed to benefits of continuing treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors. There was no evidence about types of dementia other than Alzheimer’s disease, and we were unable to draw specific conclusions about continuing or stopping treatment at different stages of the illness. We found no trials that just investigated stopping memantine. These results may help patients and their doctors to make decisions about whether or not to continue treatment, although other factors, such as side effects in an individual patient and the patient’s preferences, are also important.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Research suggests that measurable change in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers occurs years in advance of the onset of clinical symptoms ( Beckett 2010 ). In this review, we aimed to assess the ability of CSF tau biomarkers (t‐tau and p‐tau) and the CSF tau (t‐tau or p‐tau)/ABeta ratio to enable the detection of Alzheimer’s disease pathology in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These biomarkers have been proposed as important in new criteria for Alzheimer's disease dementia that incorporate biomarker abnormalities. Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of 1) CSF t‐tau, 2) CSF p‐tau, 3) the CSF t‐tau/ABeta ratio and 4) the CSF p‐tau/ABeta ratio index tests for detecting people with MCI at baseline who would clinically convert to Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other forms of dementia at follow‐up. Search methods The most recent search for this review was performed in January 2013. We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), BIOSIS Previews (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), Web of Science Core Collection, including Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), PsycINFO (OvidSP), and LILACS (BIREME). We searched specialized sources of diagnostic test accuracy studies and reviews. We checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews for additional studies. We contacted researchers for possible relevant but unpublished data. We did not apply any language or data restriction to the electronic searches. We did not use any methodological filters as a method to restrict the search overall. Selection criteria We selected those studies that had prospectively well‐defined cohorts with any accepted definition of MCI and with CSF t‐tau or p‐tau and CSF tau (t‐tau or p‐tau)/ABeta ratio values, documented at or around the time the MCI diagnosis was made. We also included studies which looked at data from those cohorts retrospectively, and which contained sufficient data to construct two by two tables expressing those biomarker results by disease status. Moreover, studies were only selected if they applied a reference standard for Alzheimer's disease dementia diagnosis, for example, the NINCDS‐ADRDA or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM‐IV) criteria. Data collection and analysis We screened all titles generated by the electronic database searches. Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of all potentially relevant studies, and the full papers for eligibility. Two independent assessors performed data extraction and quality assessment. Where data allowed, we derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity from the model we fitted to produce the summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Main results In total, 1282 participants with MCI at baseline were identified in the 15 included studies of which 1172 had analysable data; 430 participants converted to Alzheimer’s disease dementia and 130 participants to other forms of dementia. Follow‐up ranged from less than one year to over four years for some participants, but in the majority of studies was in the range one to three years. Conversion to Alzheimer’s disease dementia The accuracy of the CSF t‐tau was evaluated in seven studies (291 cases and 418 non‐cases).The sensitivity values ranged from 51% to 90% while the specificity values ranged from 48% to 88%. At the median specificity of 72%, the estimated sensitivity was 75% (95% CI 67 to 85), the positive likelihood ratio was 2.72 (95% CI 2.43 to 3.04), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.32 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.47). Six studies (164 cases and 328 non‐cases) evaluated the accuracy of the CSF p‐tau. The sensitivities were between 40% and 100% while the specificities were between 22% and 86%. At the median specificity of 47.5%, the estimated sensitivity was 81% (95% CI: 64 to 91), the positive likelihood ratio was 1.55 (CI 1.31 to 1.84), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.39 (CI: 0.19 to 0.82). Five studies (140 cases and 293 non‐cases) evaluated the accuracy of the CSF p‐tau/ABeta ratio. The sensitivities were between 80% and 96% while the specificities were between 33% and 95%. We did not conduct a meta‐analysis because the studies were few and small. Only one study reported the accuracy of CSF t‐tau/ABeta ratio. Our findings are based on studies with poor reporting. A significant number of studies had unclear risk of bias for the reference standard, participant selection and flow and timing domains. According to the assessment of index test domain, eight of 15 studies were of poor methodological quality. The accuracy of these CSF biomarkers for ‘other dementias’ had not been investigated in the included primary studies. Investigation of heterogeneity The main sources of heterogeneity were thought likely to be reference standards used for the target disorders, sources of recruitment, participant sampling, index test methodology and aspects of study quality (particularly, inadequate blinding). We were not able to formally assess the effect of each potential source of heterogeneity as planned, due to the small number of studies available to be included. Authors' conclusions The insufficiency and heterogeneity of research to date primarily leads to a state of uncertainty regarding the value of CSF testing of t‐tau, p‐tau or p‐tau/ABeta ratio for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in current clinical practice. Particular attention should be paid to the risk of misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of dementia (and therefore over‐treatment) in clinical practice. These tests, like other biomarker tests which have been subject to Cochrane DTA reviews, appear to have better sensitivity than specificity and therefore might have greater utility in ruling out Alzheimer's disease as the aetiology to the individual's evident cognitive impairment, as opposed to ruling it in. The heterogeneity observed in the few studies awaiting classification suggests our initial summary will remain valid. However, these tests may have limited clinical value until uncertainties have been addressed. Future studies with more uniformed approaches to thresholds, analysis and study conduct may provide a more homogenous estimate than the one that has been available from the included studies we have identified. Plain language summary Proteins in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) for early prediction of developing Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia in people with mild cognitive problems Background The numbers of people with dementia and other cognitive problems are increasing globally. A diagnosis of dementia at early stage is recommended but there is no agreement on the best approach. A range of tests have been developed which healthcare professionals can use to assess people with poor memory or cognitive impairment. In this review, we have focused on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diagnostic tests. Review question We reviewed the evidence about the accuracy of CSF tests in identifying those people presenting with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who would develop Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other forms of dementia over a period of time. Study characteristics The evidence is current to January 2013. We included 15 studies containing a total of 1282 participants with MCI. The majority of studies (n = 9) were published between 2010 and 2013. The remaining six studies were published between 2004 and 2009. All of the included studies were conducted in Europe. Study sizes varied and ranged from 15 to 231 participants.The mean (range) age of the youngest sample was 64 years (45 to 76) and the mean (standard deviation) age of the oldest sample was 73.4 (6.6) years. Quality of the evidence Our findings are based on studies with poor reporting, with a majority of studies at unclear risk of bias due to insufficient details given on how participants were selected and how the clinical diagnosis of dementia was established. According to the assessment of how the CSF tests were conducted and analysed, eight of 15 studies were of poor methodological quality. Key findings Below is a summary of key findings for the tests: CSF t‐tau test for conversion from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia The sensitivity values in seven individual studies ranged from 51% to 90% while the specificity values ranged from 48% to 88%. The statistical analysis of those studies showed that, at the fixed specificity of 72%, the estimated sensitivity was 77%, and, at the prevalence of 37%, the positive predictive value was 62% and the negative predictive value was 84%. Based on these results, on average 62 out of 100 people with MCI and a positive index test result would convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia but 38 would not; on average, 84 out of 100 people with MCI and with a negative index test result would not convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia, but 16 would. CSF p‐tau test for conversion from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia The sensitivity values in six individual studies ranged from 40% to 100% while the specificity values ranged from 22% to 86%. The statistical analysis of those studies showed that, at the fixed specificity of 48%, the estimated sensitivity was 81%, and, at the prevalence of 37%, the positive predictive value was 48% and the negative predictive value was 81%. Based on these results, on average 48 out of 100 people with MCI and with a positive index test result would convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia, but 52 would not; on average, 81 out of 100 people with MCI with a negative index test result would not convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia, but 19 would. We found that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diagnostic test, as a single test, lacks the accuracy to identify those people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who would develop Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other forms of dementia over a period of time. The data suggested that a negative CSF test, in people with MCI, almost indicates the absence of Alzheimer's disease as the cause of their clinical symptoms. However, a positive CSF test does not confirm the presence of Alzheimer's disease as the aetiology (cause) of their clinical symptoms. There were methodological problems in the included studies that did not allow for a clear answer to the review question. The main limitations of the review were poor reporting in the included studies, lack of a widely accepted threshold of the CSF diagnostic tests in people with MCI, variability in length of follow‐up, and the marked variation in CSF tests’ accuracy between the included studies.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Dementia is a progressive global cognitive impairment syndrome. In 2010, more than 35 million people worldwide were estimated to be living with dementia. Some people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will progress to dementia but others remain stable or recover full function. There is great interest in finding good predictors of dementia in people with MCI. The Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the best‐known and the most often used short screening tool for providing an overall measure of cognitive impairment in clinical, research and community settings. Objectives To determine the accuracy of the Mini Mental State Examination for the early detection of dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment Search methods We searched ALOIS (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Specialized Register of diagnostic and intervention studies (inception to May 2014); MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to May 2014); EMBASE (OvidSP) (1980 to May 2014); BIOSIS (Web of Science) (inception to May 2014); Web of Science Core Collection, including the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (ISI Web of Science) (inception to May 2014); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (inception to May 2014), and LILACS (BIREME) (1982 to May 2014). We also searched specialized sources of diagnostic test accuracy studies and reviews, most recently in May 2014: MEDION (Universities of Maastricht and Leuven, www.mediondatabase.nl), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, via the Cochrane Library), HTA Database (Health Technology Assessment Database, via the Cochrane Library), and ARIF (University of Birmingham, UK, www.arif.bham.ac.uk). No language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic searches and methodological filters were not used as a method to restrict the search overall so as to maximize sensitivity. We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews, tracked citations in Scopus and Science Citation Index, used searches of known relevant studies in PubMed to track related articles, and contacted research groups conducting work on MMSE for dementia diagnosis to try to locate possibly relevant but unpublished data. Selection criteria We considered longitudinal studies in which results of the MMSE administered to MCI participants at baseline were obtained and the reference standard was obtained by follow‐up over time. We included participants recruited and clinically classified as individuals with MCI under Petersen and revised Petersen criteria, Matthews criteria, or a Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5. We used acceptable and commonly used reference standards for dementia in general, Alzheimer’s dementia, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia. Data collection and analysis We screened all titles generated by the electronic database searches. Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of all potentially relevant studies. We assessed the identified full papers for eligibility and extracted data to create two by two tables for dementia in general and other dementias. Two authors independently performed quality assessment using the QUADAS‐2 tool. Due to high heterogeneity and scarcity of data, we derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity from the model we fitted to produce the summary receiver operating characteristic curve. Main results In this review, we included 11 heterogeneous studies with a total number of 1569 MCI patients followed for conversion to dementia. Four studies assessed the role of baseline scores of the MMSE in conversion from MCI to all‐cause dementia and eight studies assessed this test in conversion from MCI to Alzheimer´s disease dementia. Only one study provided information about the MMSE and conversion from MCI to vascular dementia. For conversion from MCI to dementia in general, the accuracy of baseline MMSE scores ranged from sensitivities of 23% to 76% and specificities from 40% to 94%. In relationship to conversion from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia, the accuracy of baseline MMSE scores ranged from sensitivities of 27% to 89% and specificities from 32% to 90%. Only one study provided information about conversion from MCI to vascular dementia, presenting a sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 80% with an incidence of vascular dementia of 6.2%. Although we had planned to explore possible sources of heterogeneity, this was not undertaken due to the scarcity of studies included in our analysis. Authors' conclusions Our review did not find evidence supporting a substantial role of MMSE as a stand‐alone single‐administration test in the identification of MCI patients who could develop dementia. Clinicians could prefer to request additional and extensive tests to be sure about the management of these patients. An important aspect to assess in future updates is if conversion to dementia from MCI stages could be predicted better by MMSE changes over time instead of single measurements. It is also important to assess if a set of tests, rather than an isolated one, may be more successful in predicting conversion from MCI to dementia. Plain language summary Baseline scores of Mini‐Mental State examination (MMSE) for early prediction of developing dementia in people with mild cognitive impairments (MCI) Patients with MCI should be evaluated and monitored due to their increased risk of progression to dementia. At present there are no agreements about what the best approach is to register the progression to dementia. Several cognitive function tests have been proposed for this task because most of them are easy to administer, take no longer than 10 minutes to complete, involve major executive functions, and yield an objective score. Our review assessed the current evidence related to one of those brief tests, the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE), in the prediction of decline to dementia in people with cognitive impairments. After an extensive search and analysis of available information, we did not find evidence supporting a substantial role of MMSE as a stand‐alone single‐administration test in the identification of patients who will convert to dementia in the future.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background In primary care, general practitioners (GPs) unavoidably reach a clinical judgement about a patient as part of their encounter with patients, and so clinical judgement can be an important part of the diagnostic evaluation. Typically clinical decision making about what to do next for a patient incorporates clinical judgement about the diagnosis with severity of symptoms and patient factors, such as their ideas and expectations for treatment. When evaluating patients for dementia, many GPs report using their own judgement to evaluate cognition, using information that is immediately available at the point of care, to decide whether someone has or does not have dementia, rather than more formal tests. Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of GPs’ clinical judgement for diagnosing cognitive impairment and dementia in symptomatic people presenting to primary care. To investigate the heterogeneity of test accuracy in the included studies. Search methods We searched MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), and LILACs (BIREME) on 16 September 2021. Selection criteria We selected cross‐sectional and cohort studies from primary care where clinical judgement was determined by a GP either prospectively (after consulting with a patient who has presented to a specific encounter with the doctor) or retrospectively (based on knowledge of the patient and review of the medical notes, but not relating to a specific encounter with the patient). The target conditions were dementia and cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment and dementia) and we included studies with any appropriate reference standard such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), International Classification of Diseases (ICD), aetiological definitions, or expert clinical diagnosis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened titles and abstracts for relevant articles and extracted data separately with differences resolved by consensus discussion. We used QUADAS‐2 to evaluate the risk of bias and concerns about applicability in each study using anchoring statements. We performed meta‐analysis using the bivariate method. Main results We identified 18,202 potentially relevant articles, of which 12,427 remained after de‐duplication. We assessed 57 full‐text articles and extracted data on 11 studies (17 papers), of which 10 studies had quantitative data. We included eight studies in the meta‐analysis for the target condition dementia and four studies for the target condition cognitive impairment. Most studies were at low risk of bias as assessed with the QUADAS‐2 tool, except for the flow and timing domain where four studies were at high risk of bias, and the reference standard domain where two studies were at high risk of bias. Most studies had low concern about applicability to the review question in all QUADAS‐2 domains. Average age ranged from 73 years to 83 years (weighted average 77 years). The percentage of female participants in studies ranged from 47% to 100%. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of dementia was between 2% and 56% across studies (a weighted average of 21%). For the target condition dementia, in individual studies sensitivity ranged from 34% to 91% and specificity ranged from 58% to 99%. In the meta‐analysis for dementia as the target condition, in eight studies in which a total of 826 of 2790 participants had dementia, the summary diagnostic accuracy of clinical judgement of general practitioners was sensitivity 58% (95% confidence interval (CI) 43% to 72%), specificity 89% (95% CI 79% to 95%), positive likelihood ratio 5.3 (95% CI 2.4 to 8.2), and negative likelihood ratio 0.47 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.61). For the target condition cognitive impairment, in individual studies sensitivity ranged from 58% to 97% and specificity ranged from 40% to 88%. The summary diagnostic accuracy of clinical judgement of general practitioners in four studies in which a total of 594 of 1497 participants had cognitive impairment was sensitivity 84% (95% CI 60% to 95%), specificity 73% (95% CI 50% to 88%), positive likelihood ratio 3.1 (95% CI 1.4 to 4.7), and negative likelihood ratio 0.23 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.40). It was impossible to draw firm conclusions in the analysis of heterogeneity because there were small numbers of studies. For specificity we found the data were compatible with studies that used ICD‐10, or applied retrospective judgement, had higher reported specificity compared to studies with DSM definitions or using prospective judgement. In contrast for sensitivity, we found studies that used a prospective index test may have had higher sensitivity than studies that used a retrospective index test. Authors' conclusions Clinical judgement of GPs is more specific than sensitive for the diagnosis of dementia. It would be necessary to use additional tests to confirm the diagnosis for either target condition, or to confirm the absence of the target conditions, but clinical judgement may inform the choice of further testing. Many people who a GP judges as having dementia will have the condition. People with false negative diagnoses are likely to have less severe disease and some could be identified by using more formal testing in people who GPs judge as not having dementia. Some false positives may require similar practical support to those with dementia, but some ‐ such as some people with depression ‐ may suffer delayed intervention for an alternative treatable pathology. Plain language summary Why is improving dementia diagnosis important? Dementia refers to a group of brain conditions that lead to progressive problems with memory, working‐things‐out, or functioning in everyday life. Doctors use a variety of tests to diagnose dementia. People have often reported that it can take a long time to get a diagnosis of dementia from initially presenting to a healthcare provider with symptoms suggestive of dementia. Cognitive impairment is a broader term that includes people whose brain is not functioning as well as expected given their age, but they do not have dementia, as well as people with dementia. Some people with cognitive impairment who do not have dementia may have a condition called mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Some people with MCI (but not all) will develop dementia over time. What is the aim of this review? The review authors aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of clinical judgement of general practitioners (GPs) for diagnosing dementia, and cognitive impairment, in primary care. What was studied in the review? The authors included extracted data from 11 studies, including 10 with complete data on diagnostic accuracy. The authors included eight studies in the statistical summary with a total of 2790 people, of whom 826 (30%) had dementia. The authors included four studies that investigated cognitive impairment as the condition to diagnose, with a total of 1497 people of whom 594 had cognitive impairment (40%). What are the main results of the review? The results of the review indicate that in theory, if GPs used their clinical judgement in practice for dementia, they would correctly identify 58% of the people who have dementia as having the condition (sensitivity) and 89% of the people who do not have dementia as being free of the condition (specificity). The results of the review indicate that in theory, if GPs used their clinical judgement in practice for cognitive impairment, they would correctly identify 84% of the people who have cognitive impairment as having the condition (sensitivity) and 73% of the people who do not have cognitive impairment as being free of the condition (specificity). How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? In this review there were some technical problems with the design of the original studies, and there were differences between studies that made it difficult to compare them to each other. This means that it is difficult to be certain how applicable these findings are in clinical practice. Who do the results of this review apply to? Researchers who conducted the studies in the review carried out their investigations mostly in Europe, with one study in the USA and one study in Australia. All studies included people attending their GP. Average age ranged from 73 years to 83 years (weighted average 77 years). The percentage of female participants in studies ranged from 47% to 100%. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of dementia was between 2% and 56% across studies (a weighted average of 21%). If applying these findings in settings with fewer number of people with dementia then the accuracy of the test may be different. What are the implications of this review? If these studies are indeed representative of GPs practice, then if GPs used their clinical judgement alone to diagnose dementia then this might mean that some people with dementia are incorrectly 'missed', and it is important to do further tests to confirm that the person does not have a problem. However, if a GP thinks someone has dementia there is a good chance that the diagnosis is correct and the test to confirm dementia might be different and potentially less time consuming and burdensome. The studies included in this review suggest that clinical judgement could be a useful test to determine what to do next. How up‐to‐date is this review? The review authors searched for and used studies published up to 16 September 2021.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Alzheimer's disease and related forms of dementia are becoming increasingly prevalent with the aging of many populations. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease relies on tests to evaluate cognition and discriminate between individuals with dementia and those without dementia. The Mini‐Cog is a brief, cognitive screening test that is frequently used to evaluate cognition in older adults in various settings. Objectives The primary objective of this review was to determine the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog for detecting dementia in a community setting. Secondary objectives included investigations of the heterogeneity of test accuracy in the included studies and potential sources of heterogeneity. These potential sources of heterogeneity included the baseline prevalence of dementia in study samples, thresholds used to determine positive test results, the type of dementia (Alzheimer's disease dementia or all causes of dementia), and aspects of study design related to study quality. Overall, the goals of this review were to determine if the Mini‐Cog is a cognitive screening test that could be recommended to screen for cognitive impairment in community settings. Search methods We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), Science Citation Index (Web of Science), BIOSIS previews (Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), and the Cochrane Dementia Group's developing register of diagnostic test accuracy studies to March 2013. We used citation tracking (using the database’s ‘related articles’ feature, where available) as an additional search method and contacted authors of eligible studies for unpublished data. Selection criteria We included all cross‐sectional studies that utilized the Mini‐Cog as an index test for the diagnosis of dementia when compared to a reference standard diagnosis of dementia using standardized dementia diagnostic criteria. For the current review we only included studies that were conducted on samples from community settings, and excluded studies that were conducted in primary care or secondary care settings. We considered studies to be conducted in a community setting where participants were sampled from the general population. Data collection and analysis Information from studies meeting the inclusion criteria were extracted including information on the characteristics of participants in the studies. The quality of the studies was assessed using the QUADAS‐2 criteria and summarized using risk of bias applicability and summary graphs. We extracted information on the diagnostic test accuracy of studies including the sensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence intervals of these measures and summarized the findings using forest plots. Study specific sensitivities and specificities were also plotted in receiver operating curve space. Main results Three studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 1620 participants. The sensitivities of the Mini‐Cog in the individual studies were reported as 0.99, 0.76 and 0.99. The specificity of the Mini‐Cog varied in the individual studies and was 0.93, 0.89 and 0.83. There was clinical and methodological heterogeneity between the studies which precluded a pooled meta‐analysis of the results. Methodological limitations were present in all the studies introducing potential sources of bias, specifically with respect to the methods for participant selection. Authors' conclusions There are currently few studies assessing the diagnostic test accuracy of the Mini‐Cog in community settings. The limited number of studies and the methodological limitations that are present in the current studies make it difficult to provide recommendations for or against the use of the Mini‐Cog as a cognitive screening test in community settings. Additional well‐designed studies comparing the Mini‐Cog to other brief cognitive screening tests are required in order to determine the accuracy and utility of the Mini‐Cog in community based settings. Plain language summary A brief cogntive screening test (Mini‐Cog) for the assessment of possible dementia With the aging of our populations there are increasing numbers of older adults with memory complaints and possible dementia. Identifying older adults who have dementia is important in order to help with planning their care needs and starting dementia specific treatments. In order to diagnose dementia, healthcare professionals or other service providers rely on tests of memory and other areas of cognition in combination with additional investigations. Brief memory tests, such as the Mini‐Cog, may be useful as screening tests to help identify those individuals that might benefit from further evaluation in order to determine if dementia is present. The Mini‐Cog is a brief cognitive test that involves an assessment of an older person's ability to recall three words and draw a clock. In this review, we searched medical literature databases to identify studies which evaluated how well the Mini‐Cog is able to distinguish between individuals who have dementia and those who do not have dementia when compared to in‐depth evaluation by dementia specialists. Our review focussed on those studies that were conducted in community based settings. We identified three unique randomised controlled studies that evaluated the Mini‐Cog. In these studies the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog varied and importantly there were some potential limitations within the studies which may have led to an overestimation of the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog. Based on the information that we obtained from our review, we felt that further research into the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog was required before it could be recommended for routine use for identifying dementia in community settings.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias relies on clinical assessment. There is a high prevalence of cognitive disorders, including undiagnosed dementia in secondary care settings. Short cognitive tests can be helpful in identifying those who require further specialist diagnostic assessment; however, there is a lack of consensus around the optimal tools to use in clinical practice. The Mini‐Cog is a short cognitive test comprising three‐item recall and a clock‐drawing test that is used in secondary care settings. Objectives The primary objective was to determine the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog for detecting dementia in a secondary care setting. The secondary objectives were to investigate the heterogeneity of test accuracy in the included studies and potential sources of heterogeneity. These potential sources of heterogeneity will include the baseline prevalence of dementia in study samples, thresholds used to determine positive test results, the type of dementia (Alzheimer's disease dementia or all causes of dementia), and aspects of study design related to study quality. Search methods We searched the following sources in September 2012, with an update to 12 March 2019: Cochrane Dementia Group Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies, MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), BIOSIS Previews (Web of Knowledge), Science Citation Index (ISI Web of Knowledge), PsycINFO (OvidSP), and LILACS (BIREME). We made no exclusions with regard to language of Mini‐Cog administration or language of publication, using translation services where necessary. Selection criteria We included cross‐sectional studies and excluded case‐control designs, due to the risk of bias. We selected those studies that included the Mini‐Cog as an index test to diagnose dementia where dementia diagnosis was confirmed with reference standard clinical assessment using standardised dementia diagnostic criteria. We only included studies in secondary care settings (including inpatient and outpatient hospital participants). Data collection and analysis We screened all titles and abstracts generated by the electronic database searches. Two review authors independently checked full papers for eligibility and extracted data. We determined quality assessment (risk of bias and applicability) using the QUADAS‐2 tool. We extracted data into two‐by‐two tables to allow calculation of accuracy metrics for individual studies, reporting the sensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence intervals of these measures, summarising them graphically using forest plots. Main results Three studies with a total of 2560 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria, set in neuropsychology outpatient referrals, outpatients attending a general medicine clinic, and referrals to a memory clinic. Only n = 1415 (55.3%) of participants were included in the analysis to inform evaluation of Mini‐Cog test accuracy, due to the selective use of available data by study authors. There were concerns related to high risk of bias with respect to patient selection, and unclear risk of bias and high concerns related to index test conduct and applicability. In all studies, the Mini‐Cog was retrospectively derived from historic data sets. No studies included acute general hospital inpatients. The prevalence of dementia ranged from 32.2% to 87.3%. The sensitivities of the Mini‐Cog in the individual studies were reported as 0.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.71), 0.60 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.72), and 0.87 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.90). The specificity of the Mini‐Cog for each individual study was 0.87 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.92), 0.65 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.73), and 1.00 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.00). We did not perform meta‐analysis due to concerns related to risk of bias and heterogeneity. Authors' conclusions This review identified only a limited number of diagnostic test accuracy studies using Mini‐Cog in secondary care settings. Those identified were at high risk of bias related to patient selection and high concerns related to index test conduct and applicability. The evidence was indirect, as all studies evaluated Mini‐Cog differently from the review question, where it was anticipated that studies would conduct Mini‐Cog and independently but contemporaneously perform a reference standard assessment to diagnose dementia. The pattern of test accuracy varied across the three studies. Future research should evaluate Mini‐Cog as a test in itself, rather than derived from other neuropsychological assessments. There is also a need for evaluation of the feasibility of the Mini‐Cog for the detection of dementia to help adequately determine its role in the clinical pathway. Plain language summary How accurate is the Mini‐Cog in detecting dementia among patients in inpatient and outpatient hospital settings? Why is recognising dementia important? Dementia is a common and important condition, and many of those living with dementia have never had the condition diagnosed. Diagnosis provides opportunities for social support, advance care planning and, in specific disease types, treatment with medication. However, incorrectly diagnosing dementia when it is not present (a false‐positive result) can be distressing for the individual and their family and lead to a waste of resources in diagnostic tests. What was the aim of the review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate the Mini‐Cog test is for detecting dementia among patients in inpatient and outpatient hospital settings. The researchers included three studies to answer this question. What was studied in the review? The Mini‐Cog is a short test of memory and thinking skills that tests the ability of an individual to remember three specific objects, named at the beginning of a short assessment, repeated at the time and recalled by the individual later. In addition, the individual being assessed is asked to draw a clock face at a specific time. Points are scored based on the ability to recall the three items and the completeness of the clock. The Mini‐Cog is a short test that would typically be used to identify if someone was having difficulty with memory and thinking skills who would benefit from referral to a specialist for more detailed assessment. What are the main results of the review? The review included data from three relevant studies with a total of 2560 participants. However, the study authors did not use data from many of those participants they assessed, leaving results from only 1415 participants that provide complete and useful information for addressing the review question. All three studies scored the Mini‐Cog results in the way that was recommended by the developers of the tool. There was no clear pattern in the results of what a positive result of a Mini‐Cog test meant across the three studies, making it difficult to draw summary conclusions. Using the studies with the highest and lowest Mini‐Cog results indicated that if the Mini‐Cog were to be used in secondary care in a group of 1000 people, where 640 (64%) have dementia, an estimated 510 to 557 would have a positive Mini‐Cog, of which 0 to 126 would be incorrectly classified as having dementia. Of the 443 to 490 people with a result indicating dementia is not present, 83 to 256 would be incorrectly classified as not having dementia. How reliable are the results of the studies in the review? In the included studies, the diagnosis of dementia was made by assessing all patients with a detailed clinical assessment. Detailed clinical assessment is the reference standard to which the Mini‐Cog was compared. This is likely to have been a reliable method for determining whether patients actually had dementia. However, there were some problems with how the studies were conducted in terms of the people who were included and how the Mini‐Cog was calculated, which could result in the Mini‐Cog appearing more accurate than it actually is. We decided that it was not appropriate to group the studies together to describe the average performance of the Mini‐Cog, due to the differences among them. To whom do the results of this review apply? The studies included in the review were conducted in the USA, Germany, and Brazil. Two studies included those patients referred to specialists evaluating memory and thinking skills, and one study recruited individuals attending a medical outpatient clinic. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of dementia was between 32% and 87% (an average of 64%). What are the implications of this review? The small number of studies identified and variation in how they used the Mini‐Cog limit the evidence to make recommendations, and suggest that Mini‐Cog may not be the best test to recommend for use in inpatient and outpatient secondary care hospital settings. How up‐to‐date is this review? The review authors searched for and considered studies published up to March 2019.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a cognitive test that is commonly used as part of the evaluation for possible dementia. Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) at various cut points for dementia in people aged 65 years and over in community and primary care settings who had not undergone prior testing for dementia. Search methods We searched the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), LILACS (BIREME), ALOIS, BIOSIS previews (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), and Web of Science Core Collection, including the Science Citation Index and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science). We also searched specialised sources of diagnostic test accuracy studies and reviews: MEDION (Universities of Maastricht and Leuven, www.mediondatabase.nl), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, via the Cochrane Library), HTA Database (Health Technology Assessment Database, via the Cochrane Library), and ARIF (University of Birmingham, UK, www.arif.bham.ac.uk). We attempted to locate possibly relevant but unpublished data by contacting researchers in this field. We first performed the searches in November 2012 and then fully updated them in May 2014. We did not apply any language or date restrictions to the electronic searches, and we did not use any methodological filters as a method to restrict the search overall. Selection criteria We included studies that compared the 11‐item (maximum score 30) MMSE test (at any cut point) in people who had not undergone prior testing versus a commonly accepted clinical reference standard for all‐cause dementia and subtypes (Alzheimer disease dementia, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia). Clinical diagnosis included all‐cause (unspecified) dementia, as defined by any version of the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  (DSM); International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the Clinical Dementia Rating. Data collection and analysis At least three authors screened all citations.Two authors handled data extraction and quality assessment. We performed meta‐analysis using the hierarchical summary receiver‐operator curves (HSROC) method and the bivariate method. Main results We retrieved 24,310 citations after removal of duplicates. We reviewed the full text of 317 full‐text articles and finally included 70 records, referring to 48 studies, in our synthesis. We were able to perform meta‐analysis on 28 studies in the community setting (44 articles) and on 6 studies in primary care (8 articles), but we could not extract usable 2 x 2 data for the remaining 14 community studies, which we did not include in the meta‐analysis. All of the studies in the community were in asymptomatic people, whereas two of the six studies in primary care were conducted in people who had symptoms of possible dementia. We judged two studies to be at high risk of bias in the patient selection domain, three studies to be at high risk of bias in the index test domain and nine studies to be at high risk of bias regarding flow and timing. We assessed most studies as being applicable to the review question though we had concerns about selection of participants in six studies and target condition in one study. The accuracy of the MMSE for diagnosing dementia was reported at 18 cut points in the community (MMSE score 10, 14‐30 inclusive) and 10 cut points in primary care (MMSE score 17‐26 inclusive). The total number of participants in studies included in the meta‐analyses ranged from 37 to 2727, median 314 (interquartile range (IQR) 160 to 647). In the community, the pooled accuracy at a cut point of 24 (15 studies) was sensitivity 0.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.92), specificity 0.90 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.95); at a cut point of 25 (10 studies), sensitivity 0.87 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.93), specificity 0.82 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.92); and in seven studies that adjusted accuracy estimates for level of education, sensitivity 0.97 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.00), specificity 0.70 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.85). There was insufficient data to evaluate the accuracy of the MMSE for diagnosing dementia subtypes.We could not estimate summary diagnostic accuracy in primary care due to insufficient data. Authors' conclusions The MMSE contributes to a diagnosis of dementia in low prevalence settings, but should not be used in isolation to confirm or exclude disease. We recommend that future work evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of tests in the context of the diagnostic pathway experienced by the patient and that investigators report how undergoing the MMSE changes patient‐relevant outcomes. Plain language summary Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) for the detection of dementia in people aged over 65 The term 'dementia' covers a group of brain problems that cause gradual deterioration of brain function, thinking skills, and ability to perform everyday tasks (e.g. washing and dressing). People with dementia may also develop problems with their mental health (mood and emotions) and behaviour that are difficult for other people to manage or deal with. The process that causes dementia in the brain is often degenerative (due to brain damage over time). Subtypes of dementia include Alzheimer's disease dementia, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies and frontotemporal dementia. We aimed to assess the accuracy of the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE), which is commonly used as part of the process when considering a diagnosis of dementia, according to the definition in the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  ( DSM ). The MMSE is a paper‐based test with a maximum score of 30, with lower scores indicating more severe cognitive problems. The cut point established for the MMSE defines 'normal' cognitive function and is usually set at 24, although theoretically it could fall anywhere from 1 to 30. We searched a wide range of resources and found 24,310 unique citations (hits). We reviewed the full text of 317 academic papers and finally included 70 articles, referring to 48 studies in our review. We included community studies (by which we mean people living in the community who have ) and primary care studies (by which we mean studies that had an office‐based first contact care with a non specialist clinician ‐ which would often be a GP). Two of the studies had serious design weaknesses with regard to their methods for selecting participants, three with regard to the application of the test (MMSE), and nine with regard to the presentation of flow and timing. We were able to do a combined statistical analysis (meta‐analysis) on 28 studies in the community setting (44 articles) and 6 studies in primary care (8 articles), but we could not extract usable data for the remaining 14 community studies. Two of the six studies in primary care were conducted in people who had symptoms of possible dementia. We were able to calculate the summary diagnostic accuracy of the MMSE at three cut points in community‐based studies, but we didn't have enough data to do this in the primary care studies. A perfect test would have sensitivity (ability to identify anyone with dementia) of 1.0 (100%) and specificity (ability to identify people without dementia) of 1.0 (100%). For the MMSE, the summary accuracy at a cut point of 25 (10 studies) was sensitivity 0.87 and specificity 0.82. In seven studies that adjusted accuracy estimates for level of education, we found that the test had a sensitivity of 0.97 and specificity of 0.70. The summary accuracy at a cut point of 24 (15 studies) was sensitivity 0.85 and specificity 0.90. Based on these results, we would expect 85% of people with dementia to be correctly identified with the MMSE, while 15% would be wrongly classified as not having dementia; 90% of those tested would be correctly identified as not having dementia whilst 10% would be false positives and might be referred for further testing. Our results support the use of the MMSE as part of the process for deciding whether or not someone has dementia, but the results of the test should be interpreted in broader context of the individual patient, such as their personality, behaviour and how they are managing at home and in daily life.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common cause of neurodegenerative dementia of old age. Its accurate recognition can be important in clinical management and is essential for the development of disease‐modifying treatments. The current clinical diagnostic criteria are limited particularly by relatively poor sensitivity. Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging using single‐photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is the most highly developed supplementary test for DLB, and is now incorporated as a suggestive feature in the consensus diagnostic criteria. However, there is uncertainty about its accuracy and its place in clinical practice. It is most commonly used in people who are already suspected of having DLB. Objectives We had two objectives in this review: (A) to estimate the accuracy of DAT imaging for the diagnosis of DLB in people with dementia in secondary care (specialist dementia services), and (B) to estimate the accuracy of DAT imaging for the diagnosis of DLB in people with dementia in secondary care who are already suspected of having DLB on the basis of a prior clinical work‐up. Search methods We searched MEDLINE (1946 to February 2013), Embase (1980 to February 2013), BIOSIS Previews (1926 to February 2013), PsycINFO (1806 to February 2013), CINAHL (1982 to February 2013), LILACS (February 2013) and Web of Science and Conference Proceedings (ISI Web of Science) (1945 to February 2013). Several of these sources contain conference abstracts. We also searched four specialised databases containing diagnostic reviews: Meta‐analyses van Diagnostisch Onderzoek (MEDION; February 2013), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; February 2013), Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA; February 2013), and Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility (ARIF; February 2013). We checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews for potential additional studies. Terms for electronic database searching were devised in conjunction with the team at the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group. Selection criteria Study design:  We included test accuracy studies with delayed verification, diagnostic case‐control studies, and two‐gate studies with alternative diagnosis controls.  Participants:  (A) participants with dementia in secondary care, (B) participants in secondary care meeting consensus clinical criteria (other than the DAT imaging criterion) for possible or probable DLB, or both.  Index test:  SPECT or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of brain dopamine transporters.  Reference standard:  Neuropathological diagnosis at autopsy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. We extracted results into a 2x2 table, showing the binary test results cross‐classified with the binary reference standard. We used this data to calculate sensitivities, specificities, and their 95% confidence intervals. We used the QUADAS‐2 tool plus some additional items to assess methodological quality. Main results We included one study that was applicable to our first objective (A). It reported data on 22 participants who met consensus clinical criteria for DLB or National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS‐ADRDA) criteria for Alzheimer's disease, or both (a two‐gate design with alternative diagnosis controls). The index test was SPECT scanning using the ligand  123 I‐FP‐CIT. We considered the study to be at high risk of bias in the participant selection and index test domains (QUADAS‐2).  123 I‐FP‐CIT SPECT analysed semiquantitatively had a sensitivity of 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.00) and a specificity of 0.92 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.00) for the diagnosis of DLB (n = 22, 1 study). Analysed visually, the sensitivity was 0.86 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.00) and the specificity was 0.83 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.98) (n = 19, 1 study). We considered that the study also provided the best available data to address our second objective (B). At baseline, 15 participants were clinically suspected of having DLB. In this group,  123 I‐FP‐CIT SPECT scanning analysed semiquantitatively had a sensitivity of 1.00 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.00) and a specificity of 1.00 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.00) for the diagnosis of DLB (n = 15, 1 study). Analysed visually, accuracy in this group was lower with a sensitivity of 0.83 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.00) and a specificity of 0.71 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.96) (n = 13, 1 study). Authors' conclusions Only one study has used a neuropathological reference standard to assess the accuracy of DAT imaging for the diagnosis of DLB. The small size of the included study means that sensitivity and specificity estimates are imprecise. However, data from this study suggest that DAT imaging is more accurate than clinical diagnosis. Clinical diagnosis is therefore unsuitable to use as a reference standard for assessing the accuracy of DAT imaging. No studies using a neuropathological reference standard have directly addressed the common clinical scenario where the use of DAT imaging is considered as a diagnostic test in a person with possible DLB, or assessed the accuracy of DAT imaging in people with mild dementia. However, the data from the included study suggest that, where there is moderately severe dementia and a strong pre‐existing suspicion of DLB (probable DLB), then a normal (123)I‐FP‐CIT SPECT scan may be an accurate means of excluding the diagnosis. Semiquantitative ratings of  123 I‐FP‐CIT SPECT scans appeared to be more accurate than visual ratings in all analyses. Plain language summary Dopamine transporter imaging for the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is one of the more common causes of dementia in old age. At present, it is diagnosed on the basis of the presence of characteristic symptoms, of which the most important are visual hallucinations, fluctuations in cognition, and Parkinsonism (movement symptoms like those seen in Parkinson's disease). However, many people who have DLB do not have all of these symptoms, and it can be hard to distinguish from other causes of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is important to diagnose it accurately because people with DLB can have particularly severe side effects if given antipsychotic medication and, in the long term, so that treatments can be improved. Diagnosis of DLB using clinical symptoms alone has proven in some studies not to be very sensitive, that is cases of DLB are often missed. People with DLB have reduced levels of the dopamine transporter protein (DAT) in a part of the brain known as the corpus striatum. It is possible, using tracers that bind to the dopamine transporter, to identify this reduction on certain brain scans (PET or SPECT scans). This is known as DAT imaging. It has been suggested that DAT imaging may help in the accurate diagnosis of DLB. In this review, we aimed to assess how accurately DAT imaging can identify DLB among all people with dementia seen in specialist dementia services (secondary care). Because DAT scans are expensive, they are usually used in people in whom a doctor already suspects the presence of DLB, so we also aimed to see how accurately DAT imaging identified DLB among these people. We only looked for studies in which the diagnosis was confirmed by examining the person's brain after death. We found only one study of 22 participants to include in the review. The participants had been selected for the study because they had been diagnosed clinically with DLB or AD. This method of recruiting participants tends to exaggerate the accuracy of a test. The participants in the study had moderately severe dementia when they had the DAT imaging. Overall, the DAT imaging correctly classified 100% of the participants who had DLB and 92% of the participants who did not have DLB at postmortem. When we looked at only the 15 participants whom the doctors thought had DLB at the start of the study, then the DAT imaging correctly classified 100% of the participants who had DLB and 100% of the participants who did not have DLB at postmortem. The small size of the included study meant that we could not be very confident in these estimates of accuracy, and it is still possible that the test is considerably less accurate than this would suggest. We can conclude that DAT imaging is a promising test for diagnosing DLB, but it is important to note that we did not find any studies of participants in whom diagnosis may be more difficult, such as those with only mild dementia or those who have only one symptom to raise a suspicion of DLB.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Cerebral small vessel disease is a progressive disease of the brain's deep perforating blood vessels. It is usually diagnosed based on lesions seen on brain imaging. Cerebral small vessel disease is a common cause of stroke but can also cause a progressive cognitive decline. As antithrombotic therapy is an established treatment for stroke prevention, we sought to determine whether antithrombotic therapy might also be effective in preventing cognitive decline in people with small vessel disease. Objectives To assess the effects of antithrombotic therapy for prevention of cognitive decline in people with small vessel disease on neuroimaging but without dementia. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Review Group's Specialised Register, and the Cochrane Stroke Group's Specialised Register; the most recent search was on 21 July 2021. We also searched MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases and two trials registries. We searched the reference lists of the articles retrieved from these searches. As trials with a stroke focus may include relevant subgroup data, we complemented these searches with a focussed search of all antithrombotic titles in the Cochrane Stroke Group database.  Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) of people with neuroimaging evidence of at least mild cerebral small vessel disease (defined here as white matter hyperintensities, lacunes of presumed vascular origin and subcortical infarcts) but with no evidence of dementia. The trials had to compare antithrombotic therapy of minimum 24 weeks' duration to no antithrombotic therapy (either placebo or treatment as usual), or compare different antithrombotic treatment regimens. Antithrombotic therapy could include antiplatelet agents (as monotherapy or combination therapy), anticoagulants or a combination. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened all the titles identified by the searches. We assessed full texts for eligibility for inclusion according to our prespecified selection criteria, extracted data to a proforma and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool for RCTs. We evaluated the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Due to heterogeneity across included participants, interventions and outcomes of eligible trials, it was not possible to perform meta‐analyses. Main results We included three RCTs (3384 participants). One study investigated the effect of antithrombotic therapy in participants not yet on antithrombotic therapy; two studies investigated the effect of additional antithrombotic therapy, one in a population already taking a single antithrombotic agent and one in a mixed population (participants on an antithrombotic drug and antithrombotic‐naive participants). Intervention and follow‐up durations varied from 24 weeks to four years. Jia 2016 was a placebo‐controlled trial assessing 24 weeks of treatment with DL‐3‐n‐butylphthalide (a compound with multimodal actions, including a putative antiplatelet effect) in 280 Chinese participants with vascular cognitive impairment caused by subcortical ischaemic small vessel disease, but without dementia. There was very low‐certainty evidence for a small difference in cognitive test scores favouring treatment with DL‐3‐n‐butylphthalide, as measured by the 12‐item Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale‐Cognitive subscale (adjusted mean difference −1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) −2.02 to −0.12), but this difference may not be clinically relevant. There was also very low‐certainty evidence for greater proportional improvement measured with the Clinician Interview‐Based Impression of Change‐Plus Caregiver Input (57% with DL‐3‐n‐butylphthalide versus 42% with placebo; P = 0.01), but there was no difference in other measures of cognition (Mini‐Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating) or function. There was no evidence of a difference in adverse events between treatment groups. The SILENCE RCT compared antithrombotic therapy (aspirin) and placebo during four years of treatment in 83 participants with 'silent brain infarcts' who were on no prior antithrombotic therapy. There was very low‐certainty evidence for no difference between groups across various measures of cognition and function, rates of stroke or adverse events. The Secondary Prevention of Subcortical Stroke Study (SPS3) compared dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) to aspirin alone in 3020 participants with recent lacunar stroke. There was low‐certainty evidence of no effect on cognitive outcomes as measured by the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instruments (CASI) assessed annually over five years. There was also low‐certainty evidence of no difference in the annual incidence of mild cognitive decline between the two treatment groups (9.7% with dual antiplatelet therapy versus 9.9% with aspirin), or the annual stroke recurrence rate (2.5% with dual antiplatelet therapy versus 2.7% with aspirin). Bleeding risk may be higher with dual antiplatelet therapy (hazard ratio (HR) 2.15, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.11; low certainty evidence), but there may be no significant increase in intracerebral bleeding risk (HR 1.52, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.93; low‐certainty evidence). None of the included trials assessed the incidence of new dementia. Authors' conclusions We found no convincing evidence to suggest any clinically relevant cognitive benefit of using antithrombotic therapy in addition to standard treatment in people with cerebral small vessel disease but without dementia, but there may be an increased bleeding risk with this approach. There was marked heterogeneity across the trials and the certainty of the evidence was generally poor. Plain language summary Antithrombotic therapy to prevent cognitive decline in people with small vessel disease on neuroimaging but without dementia Background Disruption of blood flow to the brain can cause problems with memory and thinking. In the condition called 'cerebral small vessel disease', there is damage to the smallest blood vessels that run deep in the brain. This damage can cause stroke but can also be seen on brain scans in people with no obvious stroke symptoms. Cerebral small vessel disease usually gets worse over time, and in some people can cause a decline in memory and thinking. If this decline gets severe enough to affect a person's ability to manage their daily activities independently, then it is described as a type of vascular dementia. We know that blood‐thinning medications such as aspirin can prevent stroke. We wanted to know whether blood‐thinning medications might also prevent the decline in memory and thinking that is seen in cerebral small vessel disease. Review question   Are blood‐thinning medications effective and safe in preventing the decline in memory and thinking in people with cerebral small vessel disease? What we did  We searched the medical literature up to 21 July 2021 looking for studies that compared blood‐thinning medications given over at least 24 weeks to a comparator, which could have been either usual care or a placebo (dummy) tablet. To make the comparison fair, the studies had to assign people randomly to blood‐thinning medications or the comparator treatment. We were interested in the effects on participants' performance in memory and thinking tests, their ability to look after themselves, their risk of developing dementia and stroke, and side effects (especially from bleeding). Because the studies were so different from each other in terms of the type of participants, medications and assessments, we were unable to combine the results in analyses. Rather, we described the results of individual studies and assessed how confident we were in their findings. What we found   We included three studies with 3384 participants. These studies were very different in terms of the participants (some with and some without stroke), the medications studied (single and combinations of different blood‐thinners), and how the effects on memory and thinking were measured (different tests used for assessment). No trial consistently demonstrated an improvement in performance in memory and thinking tests or in daily activities. No trial assessed for a new diagnosis of dementia. There was suggestion of blood‐thinning medications possibly causing an increased risk of bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding, but the numbers were too small to be certain that this was not just a chance difference. Overall, we considered that the quality of the evidence was poor for answering our review question regarding memory and thinking. Much of the information we needed was not reported. Two of the three studies were small, meaning that there was uncertainty around their results. In the only study that reported any benefit from blood‐thinning medication, different measures of memory and thinking did not all agree with each other. Lastly, where there was an improvement in memory and thinking, the size of this improvement may have been too small to make a noticeable difference to the individual in reality. Conclusions  We found no convincing evidence that taking blood‐thinning medications is beneficial for memory and thinking in people with cerebral small vessel disease. However, the studies were very different from each other, and each one had limitations with regard to our review question.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Over 35 million people are estimated to be living with dementia in the world and the societal costs are very high. Case management is a widely used and strongly promoted complex intervention for organising and co‐ordinating care at the level of the individual, with the aim of providing long‐term care for people with dementia in the community as an alternative to early admission to a care home or hospital. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of case management approaches to home support for people with dementia, from the perspective of the different people involved (patients, carers, and staff) compared with other forms of treatment, including ‘treatment as usual’, standard community treatment and other non‐case management interventions. Search methods We searched the following databases up to 31 December 2013: ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science (including Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED) and Social Science Citation Index), Campbell Collaboration/SORO database and the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group. We updated this search in March 2014 but results have not yet been incorporated. Selection criteria We include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of case management interventions for people with dementia living in the community and their carers. We screened interventions to ensure that they focused on planning and co‐ordination of care. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as required by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors independently extracted data and made 'Risk of bias' assessments using Cochrane criteria. For continuous outcomes, we used the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) between groups along with its confidence interval (95% CI). We applied a fixed‐ or random‐effects model as appropriate. For binary or dichotomous data, we generated the corresponding odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. We assessed heterogeneity by the I² statistic. Main results We include 13 RCTs involving 9615 participants with dementia in the review. Case management interventions in studies varied. We found low to moderate overall risk of bias; 69% of studies were at high risk for performance bias. The case management group were significantly less likely to be institutionalised (admissions to residential or nursing homes) at six months (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98, n = 5741, 6 RCTs, I² = 0%, P = 0.02) and at 18 months (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.61, n = 363, 4 RCTs, I² = 0%, P = 0.003). However, the effects at 10 ‐ 12 months (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08, n = 5990, 9 RCTs, I² = 48%, P = 0.39) and 24 months (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.03, n = 201, 2 RCTs, I² = 0%, P = 0.94) were uncertain. There was evidence from one trial of a reduction in the number of days per month in a residential home or hospital unit in the case management group at six months (MD ‐5.80, 95% CI ‐7.93 to ‐3.67, n = 88, 1 RCT, P < 0.0001) and at 12 months (MD ‐7.70, 95% CI ‐9.38 to ‐6.02, n = 88, 1 RCT, P < 0.0001). One trial reported the length of time until participants were institutionalised at 12 months and the effects were uncertain (hazard ratio (HR): 0.66, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.14, P = 0.14). There was no difference in the number of people admitted to hospital at six (4 RCTs, 439 participants), 12 (5 RCTs, 585 participants) and 18 months (5 RCTs, 613 participants). For mortality at 4 ‐ 6, 12, 18 ‐ 24 and 36 months, and for participants' or carers' quality of life at 4, 6, 12 and 18 months, there were no significant effects. There was some evidence of benefits in carer burden at six months (SMD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐0.12 to ‐0.01, n = 4601, 4 RCTs, I² = 26%, P = 0.03) but the effects at 12 or 18 months were uncertain. Additionally, some evidence indicated case management was more effective at reducing behaviour disturbance at 18 months (SMD ‐0.35, 95% CI ‐0.63 to ‐0.07, n = 206, 2 RCTs I² = 0%, P = 0.01) but effects were uncertain at four (2 RCTs), six (4 RCTs) or 12 months (5 RCTs). The case management group showed a small significant improvement in carer depression at 18 months (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.16 to ‐0.01, n = 2888, 3 RCTs, I² = 0%, P = 0.03). Conversely, the case management group showed greater improvement in carer well‐being in a single study at six months (MD ‐2.20 CI CI ‐4.14 to ‐0.26, n = 65, 1 RCT, P = 0.03) but the effects were uncertain at 12 or 18 months. There was some evidence that case management reduced the total cost of services at 12 months (SMD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐0.12 to ‐0.02, n = 5276, 2 RCTs, P = 0.01) and incurred lower dollar expenditure for the total three years (MD= ‐705.00, 95% CI ‐1170.31 to ‐239.69, n = 5170, 1 RCT, P = 0.003). Data on a number of outcomes consistently indicated that the intervention group received significantly more community services. Authors' conclusions There is some evidence that case management is beneficial at improving some outcomes at certain time points, both in the person with dementia and in their carer. However, there was considerable heterogeneity between the interventions, outcomes measured and time points across the 13 included RCTs. There was some evidence from good‐quality studies to suggest that admissions to care homes and overall healthcare costs are reduced in the medium term; however, the results at longer points of follow‐up were uncertain. There was not enough evidence to clearly assess whether case management could delay institutionalisation in care homes. There were uncertain results in patient depression, functional abilities and cognition. Further work should be undertaken to investigate what components of case management are associated with improvement in outcomes. Increased consistency in measures of outcome would support future meta‐analysis. Plain language summary Case management approaches to home support for people with dementia Background:  Many people are affected by dementia and the numbers are expected to rise as populations age. Most types of dementia are characterised by loss of memory and impairment in other cognitive functions, accompanied by functional impairment and difficulties in performing activities of daily living. The increasing number of people with dementia means more demand for both informal and formal sources of care. The extent of support provided depends on factors such as living situation, patient's and carer's characteristics, service provision, and availability of social networks. There are also wider financial costs of care, for example carers missing work for appointments or crises, becoming part‐time workers, or leaving work altogether. Developing interventions such as case management, which enhances the co‐ordination between different agencies involved in community care, might offer the support necessary to cover some of the needs of people with dementia and their carers. How case management is organised and implemented varies widely, and access to this type of care is influenced by long‐term care funding policies and cultural variations in different countries. Case management has been tested in people with dementia and in carers in a number of countries and healthcare systems, but it is not clear whether current evidence supports its effectiveness. Study characteristics:  We found 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including 9615 participants with dementia worldwide. Eleven RCTs also included carers. Studies were conducted in different countries, varied in size and healthcare systems and compared various types of case management interventions with usual care or augmented usual care. Key findings:  Some studies examined the benefit of case management in reducing admissions to residential or nursing homes (institutionalisation). We found benefits at six months and 18 months but not at 12 and 24 months. However, when only studies which were clearly focused upon delaying institutionalisation or prolonging the period of community care were included we found a reduction in institutionalisation at 12 months. Some studies examined the benefits of case management in terms of reduced hospital length of stay, and there was evidence to suggest that it might increase at six months. Some studies indicated that case management was more effective at reducing behaviour disturbance at 18 months, reducing carer burden and depression and improving carer well‐being at six months and social support at 12 months. Case management increases the use of community services but there was some indication that overall healthcare costs may be reduced in the first year. Some studies reported that case management was no more effective than usual care in improving patient depression, functional abilities or cognition. There was not enough evidence to clearly assess whether case management could increase the length of time until people with dementia were admitted to care homes. Quality of the evidence:  There were some problems regarding the methods of the studies. Similarly, the different ways in which the case management interventions were provided and the differences in outcome measurements made it difficult to draw clear conclusions.},

Search methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS Previews, Science Citation Index, PsycINFO and LILACS databases to August 2012. In addition, we searched specialised sources containing diagnostic studies and reviews, including MEDION (Meta‐analyses van Diagnostisch Onderzoek), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), HTA (Health Technology Assessment Database), ARIF (Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility) and C‐EBLM (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine Committee for Evidence‐based Laboratory Medicine) databases. We also searched ALOIS (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group specialized register of diagnostic and intervention studies). We identified further relevant studies from the PubMed ‘related articles’ feature and by tracking key studies in Science Citation Index and Scopus. We also searched for relevant grey literature from the Web of Science Core Collection, including Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), PhD theses and contacted researchers with potential relevant data. Selection criteria Cross‐sectional designs where all participants were recruited from the same sample were sought; case‐control studies were excluded due to high chance of bias. We searched for studies from memory clinics, hospital clinics, primary care and community populations. We excluded studies of early onset dementia, dementia from a secondary cause, or studies where participants were selected on the basis of a specific disease type such as Parkinson’s disease or specific settings such as nursing homes. Data collection and analysis We extracted dementia study prevalence and dichotomised test positive/test negative results with thresholds used to diagnose dementia. This allowed calculation of sensitivity and specificity if not already reported in the study. Study authors were contacted where there was insufficient information to complete the 2x2 tables. We performed quality assessment according to the QUADAS‐2 criteria. Methodological variation in selected studies precluded quantitative meta‐analysis, therefore results from individual studies were presented with a narrative synthesis. Main results Seven studies were selected: three in memory clinics, two in hospital clinics, none in primary care and two in population‐derived samples. There were 9422 participants in total, but most of studies recruited only small samples, with only one having more than 350 participants. The prevalence of dementia was 22% to 54% in the clinic‐based studies, and 5% to 10% in population samples. In the four studies that used the recommended threshold score of 26 or over indicating normal cognition, the MoCA had high sensitivity of 0.94 or more but low specificity of 0.60 or less. Authors' conclusions The overall quality and quantity of information is insufficient to make recommendations on the clinical utility of MoCA for detecting dementia in different settings. Further studies that do not recruit participants based on diagnoses already present (case‐control design) but apply diagnostic tests and reference standards prospectively are required. Methodological clarity could be improved in subsequent DTA studies of MoCA by reporting findings using recommended guidelines (e.g. STARDdem). Thresholds lower than 26 are likely to be more useful for optimal diagnostic accuracy of MoCA in dementia, but this requires confirmation in further studies. Plain language summary Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for the detection of dementia Review question We reviewed the evidence about the accuracy of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test for detecting dementia. Background Dementia is a common condition in older people, with at least 7% of people over 65 years old in the UK affected, and numbers are increasing worldwide. In this review, we wanted to discover whether using a well‐established cognitive test, MoCA, could accurately detect dementia when compared to a gold standard diagnostic test. MoCA uses a series of questions to test different aspects of mental functioning. Study characteristics The evidence we reviewed is current to August 2012. We found seven studies that matched our criteria. There were three from memory clinics (specialist clinics where people are referred for suspected dementia), two from general hospital clinics, none from primary care and two studies carried out in the general population. All studies included older people, with the youngest average age of 61 years in one study. There were a total 9422 people included in all 7 studies though only one study had more than 350 people. The proportion of people with dementia was 5% to 10% in two population‐derived studies and 22% to 54% in the five clinic‐based studies. There was a large variation in the way the different studies were carried out: therefore we chose to present the results in a narrative summary because a statistical summary (combining all the estimates into a summary sensitivity and specificity) would not have been meaningful. Key results We found that MoCA was good at detecting dementia when using a recognised cut‐off score of less than 26. In the studies that used this cut‐off, we found the test correctly detected over 94% of people with dementia in all settings. On the other hand, the test also produced a high proportion of false positives, that is people who did not have dementia but tested positive at the 'less than 26' cut‐off. In the studies we reviewed, over 40% of people without dementia would have been incorrectly diagnosed with dementia using the MoCA. Conclusion The overall quality of the studies was not good enough to make firm recommendations on using the MoCA to detect dementia in different healthcare settings. In particular, no studies looked at how useful MoCA is for diagnosing dementia in primary care settings. It is likely that a MoCA threshold lower than 26 would be more useful for optimal diagnostic accuracy in dementia, though this requires wider confirmation.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Weight loss, malnutrition and dehydration are common problems for people with dementia. Environmental modifications such as, change of routine, context or ambience at mealtimes, or behavioural modifications, such as education or training of people with dementia or caregivers, may be considered to try to improve food and fluid intake and nutritional status of people with dementia. Objectives Primary: To assess the effects of environmental or behavioural modifications on food and fluid intake and nutritional status in people with dementia. Secondary: To assess the effects of environmental or behavioural modifications in connection with nutrition on mealtime behaviour, cognitive and functional outcomes and quality of life, in specific settings (i.e. home care, residential care and nursing home care) for different stages of dementia. To assess the adverse consequences or effects of the included interventions. Search methods We searched the Specialized Register of Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement (ALOIS), MEDLINE, Eembase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) portal/ICTRP on 17 January 2018. We scanned reference lists of other reviews and of included articles. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating interventions designed to modify the mealtime environment of people with dementia, to modify the mealtime behaviour of people with dementia or their caregivers, or both, with the intention of improving food and fluid intake. We included people with any common dementia subtype. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included trials. We assessed the quality of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Main results We included nine studies, investigating 1502 people. Three studies explicitly investigated participants with Alzheimer's disease; six did not specify the type of dementia. Five studies provided clear measures to identify the severity of dementia at baseline, and overall very mild to severe stages were covered. The interventions and outcome measures were diverse. The overall quality of evidence was mainly low to very low. One study implemented environmental as well as behavioural modifications by providing additional food items between meals and personal encouragement to consume them. The control group received no intervention. Differences between groups were very small and the quality of the evidence from this study was very low, so we are very uncertain of any effect of this intervention. The remaining eight studies implemented behavioural modifications. Three studies provided nutritional education and nutrition promotion programmes. Control groups did not receive these programmes. After 12 months, the intervention group showed slightly higher protein intake per day (mean difference (MD) 0.11 g/kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.01 to 0.23; n = 78, 1 study; low‐quality evidence), but there was no clear evidence of a difference in nutritional status assessed with body mass index (BMI) (MD ‐0.26 kg/m² favouring control, 95% CI ‐0.70 to 0.19; n = 734, 2 studies; moderate‐quality evidence), body weight (MD ‐1.60 kg favouring control, 95% CI ‐3.47 to 0.27; n = 656, 1 study; moderate‐quality evidence), or score on Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) (MD ‐0.10 favouring control, 95% CI ‐0.67 to 0.47; n = 656, 1 study; low‐quality evidence). After six months, the intervention group in one study had slightly lower BMI (MD ‐1.79 kg/m² favouring control, 95% CI ‐1.28 to ‐2.30; n = 52, 1 study; moderate‐quality evidence) and body weight (MD ‐8.11 kg favouring control, 95% CI ‐2.06 to ‐12.56; n = 52, 1 study; moderate‐quality evidence). This type of intervention may have a small positive effect on food intake, but little or no effect, or a negative effect, on nutritional status. Two studies compared self‐feeding skills training programmes. In one study, the control group received no training and in the other study the control group received a different self‐feeding skills training programme. For both comparisons the quality of the evidence was very low and we are very uncertain whether these interventions have any effect. One study investigated general training of nurses to impart knowledge on how to feed people with dementia and improve attitudes towards people with dementia. Again, the quality of the evidence was very low so that we cannot be certain of any effect. Two studies investigated vocal or tactile positive feedback provided by caregivers while feeding participants. After three weeks, the intervention group showed an increase in calories consumed per meal (MD 200 kcal, 95% CI 119.81 to 280.19; n = 42, 1 study; low‐quality evidence) and protein consumed per meal (MD 15g, 95% CI 7.74 to 22.26; n = 42, 1 study; low‐quality evidence). This intervention may increase the intake of food and liquids slightly; nutritional status was not assessed. Authors' conclusions Due to the quantity and quality of the evidence currently available, we cannot identify any specific environmental or behavioural modifications for improving food and fluid intake in people with dementia. Plain language summary Environmental and behavioural modifications for improving food and fluid intake in people with dementia What we wanted to know Weight loss, malnutrition and dehydration are common problems for people with dementia and can occur at any stage of the illness. People with dementia often develop psychological symptoms or behaviours which cause them to eat or drink less. In the later stages of the illness, they become dependent on others to help them eat or drink. We wanted to investigate how to keep people with dementia eating and drinking as well as possible. We looked for studies which changed the way food and drink are presented to people with dementia, and for studies which attempted to change the behaviour of people with dementia or of those helping them to eat. We called these environmental and behavioural modifications respectively, though some interventions include aspects of both. We were mainly interested in the effect on how much people with dementia ate and drank and on measures of how well‐nourished they were (e.g. body weight or body mass index (BMI)), but we also looked for effects on eating behaviour, symptoms of dementia and quality of life. How we tried to answer the question We searched for all the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which were relevant to our question. In these trials, some people with dementia got an environmental or behavioural modification intended to improve their eating and drinking and were then compared with other people who had not had the intervention (the control group). Whether someone got the intervention or not was decided at random. We found nine RCTs to include in our review. In total, there were 1502 people in these trials. They had varying degrees of dementia, probably mostly due to Alzheimer's disease. Seven of the trials took place in care homes. In one trial, people were given extra snacks between meals and encouraged to eat them. In three trials, people with dementia were given education about diet and eating. In two trials, people with dementia were taught skills to help them to eat independently. In three trials, training was given to the carers responsible for helping people with dementia to eat. What we found out All the trials we found tested different interventions and measured their effects in different ways. Generally, the trials were small and there were problems with the way they were done, which reduced our confidence in the results. For some interventions, the quality of the evidence was so low that we could not draw any conclusions. For others, there was a mixture of positive and negative effects. What we concluded Because of the amount and quality of the evidence we found, we cannot at the moment, identify any specific environmental or behavioural modifications for improving food and fluid intake in people with dementia.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Sleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering, and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia, and are associated with significant carer distress, increased healthcare costs, and institutionalisation. Although non‐drug interventions are recommended as the first‐line approach to managing these problems, drug treatment is often sought and used. However, there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this clinically vulnerable population. Objectives To assess the effects, including common adverse effects, of any drug treatment versus placebo for sleep disorders in people with dementia. Search methods We searched ALOIS ( www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois ), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, on 19 February 2020, using the terms: sleep, insomnia, circadian, hypersomnia, parasomnia, somnolence, rest‐activity, and sundowning. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a drug with placebo, and that had the primary aim of improving sleep in people with dementia who had an identified sleep disturbance at baseline. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias, and results. We used the mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measures of treatment effect, and where possible, synthesised results using a fixed‐effect model. Key outcomes to be included in our summary tables were chosen with the help of a panel of carers. We used GRADE methods to rate the certainty of the evidence. Main results We found nine eligible RCTs investigating: melatonin (5 studies, n = 222, five studies, but only two yielded data on our primary sleep outcomes suitable for meta‐analysis), the sedative antidepressant trazodone (1 study, n = 30), the melatonin‐receptor agonist ramelteon (1 study, n = 74, no peer‐reviewed publication), and the orexin antagonists suvorexant and lemborexant (2 studies, n = 323). Participants in the trazodone study and most participants in the melatonin studies had moderate‐to‐severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD); those in the ramelteon study and the orexin antagonist studies had mild‐to‐moderate AD. Participants had a variety of common sleep problems at baseline. Primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy or polysomnography. In one study, melatonin treatment was combined with light therapy. Only four studies systematically assessed adverse effects. Overall, we considered the studies to be at low or unclear risk of bias. We found low‐certainty evidence that melatonin doses up to 10 mg may have little or no effect on any major sleep outcome over eight to 10 weeks in people with AD and sleep disturbances. We could synthesise data for two of our primary sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (TNST) (MD 10.68 minutes, 95% CI –16.22 to 37.59; 2 studies, n = 184), and the ratio of day‐time to night‐time sleep (MD –0.13, 95% CI –0.29 to 0.03; 2 studies; n = 184). From single studies, we found no evidence of an effect of melatonin on sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset, number of night‐time awakenings, or mean duration of sleep bouts. There were no serious adverse effects of melatonin reported. We found low‐certainty evidence that trazodone 50 mg for two weeks may improve TNST (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0; 1 study, n = 30), and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53%, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1; 1 study, n = 30) in people with moderate‐to‐severe AD. The effect on time awake after sleep onset was uncertain due to very serious imprecision (MD –20.41 minutes, 95% CI –60.4 to 19.6; 1 study, n = 30). There may be little or no effect on number of night‐time awakenings (MD –3.71, 95% CI –8.2 to 0.8; 1 study, n = 30) or time asleep in the day (MD 5.12 minutes, 95% CI –28.2 to 38.4). There were no serious adverse effects of trazodone reported. The small (n = 74), phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg was reported only in summary form on the sponsor's website. We considered the certainty of the evidence to be low. There was no evidence of any important effect of ramelteon on any nocturnal sleep outcomes. There were no serious adverse effects. We found moderate‐certainty evidence that an orexin antagonist taken for four weeks by people with mild‐to‐moderate AD probably increases TNST (MD 28.2 minutes, 95% CI 11.1 to 45.3; 1 study, n = 274) and decreases time awake after sleep onset (MD –15.7 minutes, 95% CI –28.1 to –3.3: 1 study, n = 274) but has little or no effect on number of awakenings (MD 0.0, 95% CI –0.5 to 0.5; 1 study, n = 274). It may be associated with a small increase in sleep efficiency (MD 4.26%, 95% CI 1.26 to 7.26; 2 studies, n = 312), has no clear effect on sleep latency (MD –12.1 minutes, 95% CI –25.9 to 1.7; 1 study, n = 274), and may have little or no effect on the mean duration of sleep bouts (MD –2.42 minutes, 95% CI –5.53 to 0.7; 1 study, n = 38). Adverse events were probably no more common among participants taking orexin antagonists than those taking placebo (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.99; 2 studies, n = 323). Authors' conclusions We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to guide decisions about drug treatment of sleep problems in dementia. In particular, we found no RCTs of many widely prescribed drugs, including the benzodiazepine and non‐benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks for these common treatments. We found no evidence for beneficial effects of melatonin (up to 10 mg) or a melatonin receptor agonist. There was evidence of some beneficial effects on sleep outcomes from trazodone and orexin antagonists and no evidence of harmful effects in these small trials, although larger trials in a broader range of participants are needed to allow more definitive conclusions to be reached. Systematic assessment of adverse effects in future trials is essential. Plain language summary Medicines for sleep problems in dementia Background People with dementia frequently experience sleep disturbances. These can include reduced sleep at night, frequent wakening, wandering at night, and sleeping excessively during the day. These behaviours cause a lot of stress to carers, and may be associated with earlier admission to institutional care for people with dementia. They can also be difficult for care‐home staff to manage. Non‐drug approaches to treatment should be tried first, However, these may not help and medicines are often used. Since the source of the sleep problems may be changes in the brain caused by dementia, it is not clear whether normal sleeping tablets are effective for people with dementia, and there are worries that the medicines could cause significant side effects (harms). The purpose of this review In this updated Cochrane review, we tried to identify the benefits and common harms of any medicine used to treat sleep problems in people with dementia. Findings of this review We searched up to February 2020 for well‐designed trials that compared any medicine used for treating sleep problems in people with dementia with a fake medicine (placebo). We consulted a panel of carers to help us identify the most important outcomes to look for in the trials. We found nine trials (649 participants) investigating four types of medicine: melatonin (five trials), trazodone (one trial), ramelteon (one trial), and orexin antagonists (two trials). Participants in all the trials had dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The ramelteon trial, one melatonin trial, and both orexin antagonist trials were commercially funded. Overall, the evidence was moderate or low quality, meaning that further research is likely to affect the results. Participants in the trazodone trial and most of those in the melatonin trials had moderate‐to‐severe dementia, while those in the ramelteon and orexin antagonist trials had mild‐to‐moderate dementia. The five melatonin trials included 253 participants. We found no evidence that melatonin improved sleep in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The ramelteon trial had 74 participants. The limited information available did not provide any evidence that ramelteon was better than placebo. There were no serious harms for either medicine. The trazodone trial had only 30 participants. It showed that a low dose of the sedative antidepressant trazodone, 50 mg, given at night for two weeks, may increase the total time spent asleep each night (an average of 43 minutes more in the trial) and may improve sleep efficiency (the percentage of time in bed spent sleeping). It may have slightly reduced the time spent awake at night after first falling asleep, but we could not be sure of this effect. It did not reduce the number of times the participants woke up at night. There were no serious harms reported. The two orexin antagonist trials had 323 participants. We found evidence that an orexin antagonist probably has some beneficial effects on sleep. On average, participants in the trials slept 28 minutes longer at night and spent 15 minutes less time awake after first falling asleep. There was also a small increase in sleep efficiency, but no evidence of an effect on the number of times participants woke up. Side effects were no more common in participants taking the drugs than in those taking placebo. The drugs that appeared to have beneficial effects on sleep did not seem to worsen participants' thinking skills, but these trials did not assess participants' quality of life, or look in any detail at outcomes for carers. Shortcomings of this review Although we searched for them, we were unable to find any trials of other sleeping medications that are commonly prescribed to people with dementia. All participants had dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, although sleep problems are also common in other forms of dementia. No trials assessed how long participants spent asleep without interruption, a high priority outcome to our panel of carers. Only four trials measured side effects systematically. We concluded that there are significant gaps in the evidence needed to guide decisions about medicines for sleeping problems in dementia. More trials are required to inform medical practice. It is essential that trials include careful assessment of side effects.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Rarer dementias include Huntington's disease (HD), cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia in multiple sclerosis (MS) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Cholinesterase inhibitors, including donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine, are considered to be the first‐line medicines for Alzheimer's disease and some other dementias, such as dementia in Parkinson's disease. Cholinesterase inhibitors are hypothesised to work by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) which breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Cholinesterase inhibitors may also lead to clinical improvement for rarer dementias associated with neurological conditions. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of cholinesterase inhibitors for cognitive impairment or dementia associated with neurological conditions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, several trial registries and grey literature sources in August 2013. Selection criteria We included randomised, double‐blind, controlled trials assessing the efficacy of treatment of rarer dementias associated with neurological conditions with currently marketed cholinesterase inhibitors. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and quality of trials, and extracted data. We used the standard methodological procedures of the Cochrane Collaboration. Main results We included eight RCTs involving 567 participants. Six studies used a simple parallel‐group design; the other two consisted of an open‐label treatment period followed by a randomised phase. All trials were well concealed for allocation and double‐blind, however the sample sizes of most trials were small. All trials used placebo as control. We performed meta‐analyses for some outcomes in patients with MS. For all other conditions, results are presented narratively. Two trials included patients with HD; one found that cholinesterase inhibitor use in the short‐term had no statistically significant impact on the cognitive portion of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS‐Cog; 1 study, WMD 1.00, 95% CI ‐1.66 to 3.66, P = 0.46; low quality evidence), Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) Verbal Fluency Test (1 study, WMD ‐1.20, 95% CI ‐7.97 to 5.57, P = 0.73; low quality evidence), UHDRS Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT; 1 study, WMD 2.70, 95% CI ‐0.95 to 6.35, P = 0.15; low quality evidence) and other psychometric tests. The other study found that cholinesterase inhibitor use in the medium‐term improved the results of the verbal fluency test (1 study, WMD 6.43, 95% CI 0.66 to 12.20, P = 0.03; moderate quality evidence) and California Verbal Learning Test ‐ Second Edition (CVLT‐II) Recognition Task (1 study, WMD 2.42, 95% CI 0.17 to 4.67, P = 0.04; moderate quality evidence). There was no statistically significant difference between groups on the SDMT (1 study, WMD ‐0.31, 95% CI ‐7.77 to 7.15, P = 0.94; moderate quality evidence), CVLT‐II trials 1‐5 (1 study, WMD ‐2.09, 95% CI ‐11.65 to 7.47, P = 0.67; moderate quality evidence), short‐delay recall (1 study, WMD 0.35, 95% CI ‐2.87 to 3.57, P = 0.83; moderate quality evidence), or long‐delay recall (1 study, WMD ‐0.14, 95% CI ‐3.08 to 2.80, P = 0.93; moderate quality evidence), and other psychometric tests. Four trials included patients with MS; one found no differences between the cholinesterase inhibitors (short‐term) and placebo groups on the Wechsler Memory Scales general memory score (1 study, WMD 0.90, 95% CI ‐0.52 to 2.32, P = 0.22; low quality evidence). The three other trials found that, in the medium‐term ‐ cholinesterase inhibitors improved the clinician's impression of cognitive change (2 studies, OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.62, P = 0.03; high quality evidence). However, the treatment effect on other aspects of cognitive change were unclear, measured by the Selective Reminding Test (3 studies, WMD 1.47, 95% CI ‐0.39 to 3.32, P = 0.12; high quality evidence), patient's self‐reported impression of memory change (2 studies, OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.93 to 3.00, P = 0.08; high quality evidence) and cognitive change (1 study, OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.98, P = 0.89; high quality evidence), clinician's impression of memory change (1 study, OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.84, P = 0.39; moderate quality evidence), other psychometric tests, and activities of daily living ‐ patient reported impact of multiple sclerosis activities (1 study, WMD ‐1.18, 95% CI ‐3.02 to 0.66, P = 0.21; low quality evidence). One study on patients with CADASIL found a beneficial effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on the Executive interview, and Trail Making Test parts A and B. The impact of cholinesterase inhibitors on the Vascular ADAS‐Cog score (1 study, WMD 0.04, 95% CI ‐1.57 to 1.65, P = 0.96; high quality evidence), the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (1 study, WMD ‐0.09, 95% CI ‐0.48 to 0.03, P = 0.65; high quality evidence) Disability Assessment for Dementia scale (1 study, WMD 0.58, 95% CI ‐2.72 to 3.88, P = 0.73; moderate quality evidence), and other measures was unclear One study included patients with FTD. This trial consisted of an open‐label treatment period followed by a randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase. No data of primary outcomes were reported in this study. In the included studies, the most common side effect was gastrointestinal symptoms. For all conditions, compared to the treatment group, the placebo group experienced significantly less nausea (6 studies, 44/257 vs. 22/246, OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.62, P = 0.007; high quality evidence), diarrhoea (6 studies, 40/257 vs. 13/246, OR 3.26, 95% CI 1.72 to 6.19, P = 0.0003; moderate quality evidence) and vomiting (3 studies, 17/192 vs. 3/182, OR 5.76, 95% CI 1.67 to 19.87, P = 0.006; moderate quality evidence). Authors' conclusions The sample sizes of most included trials were small, and some of the results were extracted from only one study. There were no poolable data for HD, CADASIL and FTD patients and there were no results for patients with PSP. Current evidence shows that the efficacy on cognitive function and activities of daily living of cholinesterase inhibitors in people with HD, CADASIL, MS, PSP or FTD is unclear, although cholinesterase inhibitors are associated with more gastrointestinal side effects compared with placebo. Plain language summary [Cholinesterase inhibitors for rarer dementia associated with neurological conditions] There are various rarer dementias including Huntington's disease (HD), cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia in multiple sclerosis (MS) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). A group of chemicals known as cholinesterase inhibitors are considered to be the first‐line medicines for Alzheimer's disease and some other dementias. Cholinesterase inhibitors may also lead to clinical improvement for rarer dementias associated with neurological conditions. We analysed eight randomised controlled trials including 567 participants, which all used a placebo as a control. The methodological quality of most included trials was moderate. Some of the results were extracted from only one study, and there were no results for patients with PSP identified. Furthermore, some studies had small numbers of participants. The beneficial effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on cognitive function was only observed on a few cognitive function tests for patients with HD, CADASIL or MS. Cholinesterase inhibitors had no significant impact on improving cognitive level, activities of daily living and quality of life in patients with these conditions. For all conditions, compared to the treatment group, the placebo group experienced significantly less gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting). There is no evidence for the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors for these conditions.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Supplementary feeding may help food insecure and vulnerable people by optimising the nutritional value and adequacy of the diet, improving quality of life and improving various health parameters of disadvantaged families. In low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMIC), the problems supplementary feeding aims to address are entangled with poverty and deprivation, the programmes are expensive and delivery is complicated. Objectives 1. To summarise the evidence from systematic reviews of supplementary feeding for food insecure, vulnerable and malnourished populations, including children under five years of age, school‐aged children, pregnant and lactating women, people with HIV or tuberculosis (or both), and older populations. 2. To describe and explore the effects of supplementary feeding given to people in these groups, and to describe the range of outcomes between reviews and range of effects in the different groups. Methods In January 2017, we searched the  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,  MEDLINE, Embase and nine other databases. We included systematic reviews evaluating community‐based supplementary feeding, and concerning food insecure, vulnerable and malnourished populations. Two review authors independently undertook selection of systematic reviews, data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment. We assessed review quality using the AMSTAR tool, and used GRADEpro 'Summary of findings' tables from each review to indicate the certainty of the evidence for the main comparisons. We summarised review findings in the text and reported the data for each outcome in additional tables. We also used forest plots to display results graphically. Main results This overview included eight systematic reviews (with last search dates between May 2006 and February 2016). Seven were Cochrane Reviews evaluating interventions in pregnant women; children (aged from birth to five years) from LMIC; disadvantaged infants and young children (aged three months to five years); children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM); disadvantaged school children; adults and children who were HIV positive or with active tuberculosis (with or without HIV). One was a non‐Cochrane systematic review in older people with Alzheimer's disease. These reviews included 95 trials relevant to this overview, with the majority (74%) of participants from LMIC. The number of included participants varied between 91 and 7940 adults, and 271 and more than 12,595 children. Trials included a wide array of nutritional interventions that varied in duration, frequency and format, with micronutrients often reported as cointerventions. Follow‐up ranged from six weeks to two years; three trials investigated outcomes at four to 17 years of age. All reviews were rated as high quality (AMSTAR score between eight and 11). The GRADE certainty ratings ranged from very low to moderate for individual comparisons, with the evidence often comprising only one or two small trials, thereby resulting in many underpowered analyses (too small to detect small but important differences). The main outcome categories reported across reviews were death, anthropometry (adults and children) and other markers of nutritional status, disease‐related outcomes, neurocognitive development and psychosocial outcomes, and adverse events. Mortality data were limited and underpowered in meta‐analysis in all populations (children with MAM, in children with HIV, and in adults with tuberculosis) with the exception of balanced energy and protein supplementation in pregnancy, which may have reduced the risk of stillbirth (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.94; 5 trials, 3408 women). Supplementation in pregnancy also improved infant birth weight (mean difference (MD) 40.96 g, 95% CI 4.66 to 77.26; 11 trials, 5385 participants) and reduced risk of infants born small‐for‐gestational age (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90; 7 trials, 4408 participants). These effects did not translate into demonstrable long‐term benefits for children in terms of growth and neurocognitive development in the one to two trials reporting on longer‐term outcomes. In one study (505 participants), high‐protein supplementation was associated with increased risk of small‐for‐gestational age babies. Effects on growth in children were mixed. In children under five years of age from LMIC, one review found that supplementary feeding had a little or no effect on child growth; however, a more recent review in a similar population found that those who received food supplementation gained an average of 0.12 kg more in weight (MD 0.12 kg, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.18; 9 trials, 1057 participants) and 0.27 cm more in height (MD 0.27 cm, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.48; 9 trials, 1463 participants) than those who were not supplemented. Supplementary food was generally more effective for younger children (younger than two years of age) and for those who were poorer or less well‐nourished. In children with MAM, the provision of specially formulated food improved their weight, weight‐for‐height z scores and other key outcomes such as recovery rate (by 29%), as well as reducing the number of participants dropping out (by 70%). In LMIC, school meals seemed to lead to small benefits for children, including improvements in weight z scores, especially in children from lower‐income countries, height z scores, cognition or intelligence quotient tests, and maths and spelling performance. Supplementary feeding in adults who were HIV positive increased the daily energy and protein intake compared to nutritional counselling alone. Supplementation led to an initial improvement in weight gain or body mass index but did not seem to confer long‐term benefit. In adults with tuberculosis, one small trial found a significant benefit on treatment completion and sputum conversion rate. There were also significant but modest benefits in terms of weight gain (up to 2.60 kg) during active tuberculosis. The one study included in the Alzheimer's disease review found that three months of daily oral nutritional supplements improved nutritional outcomes in the intervention group. There was little or no evidence regarding people's quality of life, adherence to treatment, attendance at clinic or the costs of supplementary feeding programmes. Authors' conclusions Considering the current evidence base included, supplementary food effects are modest at best, with inconsistent and limited mortality evidence. The trials reflected in the reviews mostly reported on short‐term outcomes and across the whole of the supplementation trial literature it appears important outcomes, such as quality of life and cost of programmes, are not systematically reported or summarised. Plain language summary Supplementary feeding for groups of people that are food insecure, vulnerable and malnourished What was the aim of this review? To summarise the effect of supplementary feeding on populations that were food insecure, vulnerable and malnourished. The overview authors found eight systematic reviews examining supplementary feeding in a variety of populations. Key messages Across a range of vulnerable populations, supplementary feeding programmes sometimes show modest benefit in nutritional outcomes. In a few studies examining mortality (death), effects were either small or absent, and research mostly looked at short‐term effects. What was studied in the review? Supplementary feeding means providing extra food to people or families over and above their home diet and has been used in populations that are food insecure (limited access to adequate and nutritious food) and vulnerable (including women and young children; school‐aged children; people living with diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV, and Alzheimer's disease; and older people) to improve their health and quality of life. What are the main results of the review? The evidence presented here was current to January 2017. We found eight systematic reviews to include in this summary. These reviews included 95 studies (including up to 7940 adults, and more than 12,595 children in a few studies). Most of the included studies lasted from six weeks to two years, with only three studies following people for longer periods of time (up to 17 years). In these reviews, there were a wide range of different types of supplementary feeding given to vulnerable groups over different periods of time, and often in combination with vitamins or minerals. In pregnancy, we found that energy and protein supplements that were balanced (i.e. providing adequate amounts of energy and nutrients, in this case protein) may have decreased the rate of stillbirth (death or loss of a baby before or during delivery), improved infant birth weight and reduced the risk of infants born small‐for‐gestational age (infants that are smaller than expected). We observed no long‐term benefits for children in terms of growth and cognitive (intellectual) development (although very few studies reported long‐term effects). High‐protein supplements (containing protein in higher amounts) were associated with risk and harm (increased risk of small‐for‐gestational age babies). We found that the effects of supplementary feeding on growth in children were varied. In children under five years of age from low‐ and middle‐income countries, supplementary feeding had a small impact on child growth. We observed some benefits in terms of weight and height gains, especially in younger children (those younger than two years of age) and in those who were poorer or less well‐nourished (or both). Some benefit could be seen in children with moderate acute malnutrition in terms of weight gain, other growth factors and recovery rate. School meals seemed to lead to a number of small benefits in school children (including improvements in weight, height, intelligence tests, and maths and spelling performance). Supplementary feeding in adults who were HIV positive increased the daily intake of energy and protein and led to an early improvement in weight gain or body mass index (measure of whether someone is overweight or underweight), or both, but did not seem to lead to long‐term benefits (although few studies reported long‐term effects). In adults with tuberculosis (serious infectious lung disease), we observed small benefits in terms of weight gain during active tuberculosis. In Alzheimer's disease (a type of dementia), providing a daily oral nutrition supplement for three months improved nutritional outcomes (such as weight and energy intake). There was little or no evidence available regarding people's quality of life, adherence to treatment, attendance at clinic or the costs of supplementary feeding programmes.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Memantine is a moderate affinity uncompetitive antagonist of glutamate NMDA receptors. It is licensed for use in moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease (AD); in the USA, it is also widely used off‐label for mild AD. Objectives To determine efficacy and safety of memantine for people with dementia. To assess whether memantine adds benefit for people already taking cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs). Search methods We searched  ALOIS , the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register of trials (http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois/) up to 25 March 2018. We examined clinical trials registries, press releases and posters of memantine manufacturers; and the web sites of the FDA, EMEA and NICE. We contacted authors and companies for missing information. Selection criteria Double‐blind, parallel group, placebo‐controlled, randomised trials of memantine in people with dementia. Data collection and analysis We pooled and analysed data from four clinical domains across different aetiologies and severities of dementia and for AD with agitation. We assessed the impact of study duration, severity and concomitant use of ChEIs. Consequently, we restricted analyses to the licensed dose (20 mg/day or 28 mg extended release) and data at six to seven months duration of follow‐up, and analysed separately results for mild and moderate‐to‐severe AD. We transformed results for efficacy outcomes into the difference in points on particular outcome scales. Main results Across all types of dementia, data were available from almost 10,000 participants in 44 included trials, most of which were at low or unclear risk of bias. For nearly half the studies, relevant data were obtained from unpublished sources. The majority of trials (29 in 7885 participants) were conducted in people with AD. 1. Moderate‐to‐severe AD (with or without concomitant ChEIs). High‐certainty evidence from up to 14 studies in around 3700 participants consistently shows a small clinical benefit for memantine versus placebo: clinical global rating (CGR): 0.21 CIBIC+ points (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.30); cognitive function (CF): 3.11 Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) points (95% CI 2.42 to 3.92); performance on activities of daily living (ADL): 1.09 ADL19 points (95% CI 0.62 to 1.64); and behaviour and mood (BM): 1.84 Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) points (95% CI 1.05 to 2.76). There may be no difference in the number of people discontinuing memantine compared to placebo: risk ratio (RR) 0.93 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.04) corresponding to 13 fewer people per 1000 (95% CI 31 fewer to 7 more). Although there is moderate‐certainty evidence that fewer people taking memantine experience agitation as an adverse event: RR 0.81 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.99) (25 fewer people per 1000, 95% CI 1 to 44 fewer), there is also moderate‐certainty evidence, from three additional studies, suggesting that memantine is not beneficial as a  treatment  for agitation (e.g. Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory: clinical benefit of 0.50 CMAI points, 95% CI ‐3.71 to 4.71) . The presence of concomitant ChEI does not impact on the difference between memantine and placebo, with the possible exceptions of the BM outcome (larger effect in people taking ChEIs) and the CF outcome (smaller effect). 2. Mild AD (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 20 to 23): mainly moderate‐certainty evidence based on post‐hoc subgroups from up to four studies in around 600 participants suggests there is probably no difference between memantine and placebo for CF: 0.21 ADAS‐Cog points (95% CI ‐0.95 to 1.38); performance on ADL: ‐0.07 ADL 23 points (95% CI ‐1.80 to 1.66); and BM: ‐0.29 NPI points (95% CI ‐2.16 to 1.58). There is less certainty in the CGR evidence, which also suggests there may be no difference: 0.09 CIBIC+ points (95% CI ‐0.12 to 0.30). Memantine (compared with placebo) may increase the numbers of people discontinuing treatment because of adverse events (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.03 to 4.39). 3. Mild‐to‐moderate vascular dementia. Moderate‐ and low‐certainty evidence from two studies in around 750 participants indicates there is probably a small clinical benefit for CF: 2.15 ADAS‐Cog points (95% CI 1.05 to 3.25); there may be a small clinical benefit for BM: 0.47 NOSGER disturbing behaviour points (95% CI 0.07 to 0.87); there is probably no difference in CGR: 0.03 CIBIC+ points (95% CI ‐0.28 to 0.34); and there may be no difference in ADL: 0.11 NOSGER II self‐care subscale points (95% CI ‐0.35 to 0.54) or in the numbers of people discontinuing treatment: RR 1.05 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.34). There is limited, mainly low‐ or very low‐certainty efficacy evidence for other types of dementia (Parkinson's disease and dementia Lewy bodies (for which CGR may show a small clinical benefit; four studies in 319 people); frontotemporal dementia (two studies in 133 people); and AIDS‐related Dementia Complex (one study in 140 people)). There is high‐certainty evidence showing no difference between memantine and placebo in the proportion experiencing at least one adverse event: RR 1.03 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.06); the RR does not differ between aetiologies or severities of dementia. Combining available data from all trials, there is moderate‐certainty evidence that memantine is 1.6 times more likely than placebo to result in dizziness (6.1% versus 3.9%), low‐certainty evidence of a 1.3‐fold increased risk of headache (5.5% versus 4.3%), but high‐certainty evidence of no difference in falls. Authors' conclusions We found important differences in the efficacy of memantine in mild AD compared to that in moderate‐to‐severe AD. There is a small clinical benefit of memantine in people with moderate‐to‐severe AD, which occurs irrespective of whether they are also taking a ChEI, but no benefit in people with mild AD. Clinical heterogeneity in AD makes it unlikely that any single drug will have a large effect size, and means that the optimal drug treatment may involve multiple drugs, each having an effect size that may be less than the minimum clinically important difference. A definitive long‐duration trial in mild AD is needed to establish whether starting memantine earlier would be beneficial over the long term and safe: at present the evidence is against this, despite it being common practice. A long‐duration trial in moderate‐to‐severe AD is needed to establish whether the benefit persists beyond six months. Plain language summary Memantine as a treatment for dementia Review question We reviewed the evidence on memantine, which is one of the main drugs for treating people with dementia. We wanted to find out if memantine can slow down the course of dementia and if it is harmful in any way. We also wanted to know if adding memantine to other dementia drugs gives an extra effect. Background The commonest type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD), followed by vascular dementia. About one or two people in 100 have AD at age 65, and this rate doubles every five years. Dementia involves loss of memory, difficulty thinking and often changes in mood and behaviour. There are two main types of treatment: acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) drugs and memantine. These drugs work differently and we wanted to find out whether giving the two drug types together would work better than the ChEI drugs on their own. Study characteristics We searched for as many relevant studies as we could find that had a reliable design (randomised controlled trials) and had compared memantine with placebo for each type of dementia. We found 44 studies involving about 10,000 people. Most studies (29 in 7885 people) were in people with AD. Most studies were well conducted, but some were not well reported and we got extra information from the drug companies. We analysed the results separately for people with mild dementia and those with moderate‐to‐severe dementia. Key results Memantine has a small beneficial effect in people with moderate‐to‐severe AD. This benefit affects thinking, the ability to carry on normal daily activities, and the severity of behaviour and mood problems. Overall, it is well tolerated in those with moderate‐‐to‐severe AD, but it may cause dizziness in a few of the people taking it. An important result is that adding memantine to established ChEI treatment also results in less deterioration than placebo. However, in people with mild AD, memantine is probably no better than placebo. This is mainly moderate‐quality evidence. In vascular dementia, two studies in about 750 people indicated there is probably a small benefit for thinking difficulties, behaviour and mood, and there may be less agitation for memantine compared with placebo. This is moderate‐ or low‐quality evidence. Quality of the evidence  Overall, the evidence on memantine for AD is high quality, and comes from many trials in thousands of people. We can be confident in the findings for AD, but less so in people with other types of dementia. This plain language summary is up to date as of March 2018.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Tardive dyskinesia (TD) remains a troublesome adverse effect of conventional antipsychotic (neuroleptic) medication. It has been proposed that TD could have a component of central cholinergic deficiency. Cholinergic drugs have been used to treat TD. Objectives To determine the effects of cholinergic drugs (arecoline, choline, deanol, lecithin, meclofenoxate, physostigmine, RS 86, tacrine, metoxytacrine, galantamine, ipidacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, eptastigmine, metrifonate, xanomeline, cevimeline) for treating antipsychotic‐induced TD in people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illness. Search methods An electronic search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (16 July 2015 and April 2017) was undertaken. This register is assembled by extensive searches for randomised controlled trials in many electronic databases, registers of trials, conference proceedings and dissertations. References of all identified studies were searched for further trial citations. Selection criteria We included reports identified by the search if they were of controlled trials involving people with antipsychotic‐induced TD and chronic mental illness, who had been randomly allocated to either a cholinergic agent or to a placebo or no intervention. Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data and, where possible, estimated risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed data on an intention‐to‐treat basis, with the assumption that people who left early had no improvement. We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results We included 14 studies investigating the use of cholinergic drugs compared with placebo published between 1976 and 2014. All studies involved small numbers of participants (five to 60 people). Three studies that investigated the new cholinergic Alzheimer drugs for the treatment of TD are new to this update. Overall, the risk of bias in the included studies was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting; allocation concealment was not described, generation of the sequence was not explicit, studies were not clearly blinded, we are unsure if data are incomplete, and data were often poorly or selectively reported. We are uncertain about the effect of new or old cholinergic drugs on no clinically important improvement in TD symptoms when compared with placebo; the quality of evidence was very low (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.23; 27 people, 4 RCTs). Eight trials found that cholinergic drugs may make little or no difference to deterioration of TD symptoms (low‐quality evidence, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.24; 147 people). Again, due to very low‐quality evidence, we are uncertain about the effects on mental state (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.61; 77 people, 5 RCTs), adverse events (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.14; 106 people, 4 RCTs), and leaving the study early (RR 1.09,95% CI 0.56 to 2.10; 288 people 12 RCTs). No study reported on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life. Authors' conclusions TD remains a major public health problem. The clinical effects of both older cholinergic drugs and new cholinergic agents, now used for treating Alzheimer's disease, are unclear, as too few, too small studies leave many questions unanswered. Cholinergic drugs should remain of interest to researchers and currently have little place in routine clinical work. However, with the advent of new cholinergic agents now used for treating Alzheimer's disease, scope exists for more informative trials. If these new cholinergic agents are to be investigated for treating people with TD, their effects should be demonstrated in large well‐designed, conducted and reported randomised trials. Plain language summary Cholinergic medication for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia Review question . Are cholinergic drugs useful for treating the unpleasant side‐effect ‐ tardive dyskinesia ‐ in people with schizophrenia or other similar mental health problems who are taking antipsychotics. Background . People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). These symptoms are usually treated with antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side‐effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue and jaw to convulse, spasm and grimace. It is caused by long‐term or high dose of antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat and can be incurable. It has been proposed that tardive dyskinesia could be due to cholinergic deficiency. Older cholinergic drugs, such as deanol, lecithin and meclofenoxate, have been used to treat tardive dyskinesia. New cholinergic drugs, such as donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine, have been developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and may also be promising in the treatment for tardive dyskinesia. Study characteristics . We searched for trials in July 2015 and April 2017, using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials. The review includes 14 studies investigating the use of cholinergic drugs compared with placebo. All studies randomised small numbers of participants (five to 60 people) with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who had also developed antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia. Key results . We found the effects of both older and newer cholinergic drugs to be unclear as too few and too small studies are available and do not yield great evidence and leave many questions unanswered. Quality of the evidence . The available evidence is weak, limited, and small scale. It is not possible to recommend these drugs as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia based on our findings. To fully investigate whether the use of cholinergic drugs have any positive effects for people with tardive dyskinesia, there would have to be well‐designed, larger, longer‐term studies, particularly on new cholinergic drugs currently being used for treating Alzheimer’s disease.

abstract = {Abstract - Background There are approximately 24 million people worldwide with dementia; this is likely to increase to 81 million by 2040. Dementia is a progressive condition, and usually leads to death eight to ten years after first symptoms. End‐of‐life care should emphasise treatments that optimise quality of life and physicians should minimise unnecessary or non‐beneficial interventions. Statins are 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG‐CoA) reductase inhibitors; they have become the cornerstone of pharmacotherapy for the management of hypercholesterolaemia but their ability to provide benefit is unclear in the last weeks or months of life. Withdrawal of statins may improve quality of life in people with advanced dementia, as they will not be subjected to unnecessary polypharmacy or side effects. However, they may help to prevent further vascular events in people of advanced age who are at high risk of such events. Objectives To evaluate the effects of withdrawal or continuation of statins in people with dementia on: cognitive outcomes, adverse events, behavioural and functional outcomes, mortality, quality of life, vascular morbidity, and healthcare costs.

We also ran additional searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL,  Clinical.Trials.gov  and the WHO Portal/ICTRP on 11 February 2016, to ensure that the searches were as comprehensive and as up‐to‐date as possible. Selection criteria We included all randomised, controlled clinical trials with either a placebo or 'no treatment' control group. We applied no language restrictions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria, using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We found no studies suitable for inclusion therefore analysed no data. Main results The search strategy identified 28 unique references, all of which were excluded. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence to enable us to make an informed decision about statin withdrawal in dementia. Randomised controlled studies need to be conducted to assess cognitive and other effects of statins in participants with dementia, especially when the disease is advanced. Plain language summary Statin withdrawal in people with dementia Dementia (including Alzheimer's disease) is a global healthcare concern; there are approximately 24 million people worldwide with dementia, and this is likely to increase to 81 million by 2040. Dementia is a slowly progressing condition, and persons affected may experience a gradual decline over eight to ten years. Medications that are appropriately prescribed when someone has mild dementia may no longer be appropriate as dementia progresses to severe. Statins are prescribed to lower cholesterol levels in the blood; in most cases, they help prevent myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) or strokes, but the benefits are only seen after using them for a period of months or years. They have well known side‐effects, such as muscle pain, and it is not known if the benefits of these medications outweigh the risks in persons with advanced dementia. Study characteristics We searched several medical databases on 11 February 2016 to look for clinical trials that compared continuing a statin to withdrawing a statin, in persons with dementia. Key findings We found no studies that were suitable for our review. This highlights the need for further high quality research into this area.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Dementia is a worldwide concern. Its global prevalence is increasing. At present, there is no medication licensed to prevent or delay the onset of dementia. Inflammation has been suggested as a key factor in dementia pathogenesis. Therefore, medications with anti‐inflammatory properties could be beneficial for dementia prevention. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and adverse effects of aspirin and other non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the primary or secondary prevention of dementia. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group up to 9 January 2020. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of several major healthcare databases, trial registries and grey literature sources. We ran additional searches across MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP) and six other databases to ensure that the searches were as comprehensive and up‐to‐date as possible. We also reviewed citations of reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing aspirin or other NSAIDs with placebo for the primary or secondary prevention of dementia. We included trials with cognitively healthy participants (primary prevention) or participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or cognitive complaints (secondary prevention). Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures according to the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . We rated the strength of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Main results We included four RCTs with 23,187 participants. Because of the diversity of these trials, we did not combine data to give summary estimates, but presented a narrative description of the evidence. We identified one trial (19,114 participants) comparing low‐dose aspirin (100 mg once daily) to placebo. Participants were aged 70 years or older with no history of dementia, cardiovascular disease or physical disability. Interim analysis indicated no significant treatment effect and the trial was terminated slightly early after a median of 4.7 years' follow‐up. There was no evidence of a difference in incidence of dementia between aspirin and placebo groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15; high‐certainty evidence). Participants allocated aspirin had higher rates of major bleeding (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.60, high‐certainty evidence) and slightly higher mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.28; high‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in activities of daily living between groups (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.02; high‐certainty evidence). We identified three trials comparing non‐aspirin NSAIDs to placebo. All three trials were terminated early due to adverse events associated with NSAIDs reported in other trials. One trial (2528 participants) investigated the cyclo‐oxygenase‐2 (COX‐2) inhibitor celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) and the non‐selective NSAID naproxen (220 mg twice daily) for preventing dementia in cognitively healthy older adults with a family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Median follow‐up was 734 days. Combining both NSAID treatment arms, there was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of AD between participants allocated NSAIDs and those allocated placebo (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.89 to 4.10; moderate‐certainty evidence). There was also no evidence of a difference in rates of myocardial infarction (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.40), stroke (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 4.37) or mortality (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.43) between treatment groups (all moderate‐certainty evidence). One trial (88 participants) assessed the effectiveness of celecoxib (200 mg or 400 mg daily) in delaying cognitive decline in participants aged 40 to 81 years with mild age‐related memory loss but normal memory performance scores. Mean duration of follow‐up was 17.6 months in the celecoxib group and 18.1 months in the placebo group. There was no evidence of a difference between groups in test scores in any of six cognitive domains. Participants allocated celecoxib experienced more gastrointestinal adverse events than those allocated placebo (RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.05 to 6.75; low‐certainty evidence). One trial (1457 participants) assessed the effectiveness of the COX‐2 inhibitor rofecoxib (25 mg once daily) in delaying or preventing a diagnosis of AD in participants with MCI. Median duration of study participation was 115 weeks in the rofecoxib group and 130 weeks in the placebo group. There was a higher incidence of AD in the rofecoxib than the placebo group (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.72; moderate‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.66; moderate‐certainty evidence) or mortality (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.05; moderate‐certainty evidence). Participants allocated rofecoxib had more upper gastrointestinal adverse events (RR 3.53, 95% CI 1.17 to 10.68; moderate‐certainty evidence). Reported annual mean difference scores showed no evidence of a difference between groups in activities of daily living (year 1: no data available; year 2: 0.0, 95% CI –0.1 to 0.2; year 3: 0.1, 95% CI –0.1 to 0.3; year 4: 0.1, 95% CI –0.1 to 0.4; moderate‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions There is no evidence to support the use of low‐dose aspirin or other NSAIDs of any class (celecoxib, rofecoxib or naproxen) for the prevention of dementia, but there was evidence of harm. Although there were limitations in the available evidence, it seems unlikely that there is any need for further trials of low‐dose aspirin for dementia prevention. If future studies of NSAIDs for dementia prevention are planned, they will need to be cognisant of the safety concerns arising from the existing studies. Plain language summary Aspirin and other non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs for the prevention of dementia Review question The purpose of this review was to investigate if aspirin and other non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could help in the prevention of dementia. Background Dementia is a worldwide healthcare concern. At present, there is no medicine that is proven to delay or prevent the onset of dementia. The biology of dementia is still poorly understood. However, there are reasons to believe that inflammation may be partly responsible for some of the brain changes seen in dementia. There are many medicines that have anti‐inflammatory properties, including aspirin and NSAIDs that are often sold as pain killers. We wanted to see if these medicines had any effect on developing dementia. These medicines have a few potential side effects, including heart attack and bleeding, so we also assessed for any harmful effects of the medicines. Study characteristics We searched for relevant studies that had been published up to January 2020. We found four trials that met the inclusion criteria for this review (23,187 people). One trial was undertaken in the USA and Australia and three in the USA only. The trials included different populations. One was of aspirin in healthy people with no history of dementia, cardiovascular disease or physical disability. The other three were of NSAIDs other than aspirin and were conducted in healthy people with a family history of Alzheimer's disease, people with self‐reported memory loss and people with mild cognitive impairment (a slight but noticeable and measurable decline in cognitive abilities, including memory and thinking skills). All of the included studies had limitations. The study of aspirin was stopped early due to ineffectiveness. The three studies of other NSAIDs (celecoxib, naproxen and rofecoxib) were stopped early due to concerns around the safety. Key results and quality of the evidence The aspirin study found that low‐dose aspirin (100 mg daily) did not prevent dementia in healthy older people, but resulted in higher rates of death and major bleeding compared to placebo (pretend tablet). We were very confident in this result. The NSAID studies did not find any evidence of a difference between the NSAIDs and placebo in terms of reducing the numbers of people developing dementia. In fact, in one of the studies, more people developed dementia in the NSAID group. One of the included NSAIDs studies reported more stomach bleeding and another reported other stomach problems, such as pain, nausea and gastritis. Other side effects were similar between groups. We were moderately confident in most of the results on NSAIDs. Conclusions This review found no evidence to support the use of either aspirin or other NSAIDs for the prevention of dementia and, in fact, there was some suggestion that they may cause harm. The studies had limitations, but, given the concerns over safety, further studies of low‐dose aspirin for dementia prevention seem unlikely. If future studies of NSAIDs for dementia prevention are planned, then these will need to be mindful of the safety concerns arising from the studies included in this review and from other studies of the same medicines.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Cognitive impairment, a defining feature of dementia, plays an important role in the compromised functional independence that characterises the condition. Cognitive training (CT) is an approach that uses guided practice on structured tasks with the direct aim of improving or maintaining cognitive abilities. Objectives • To assess effects of CT on cognitive and non‐cognitive outcomes for people with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers. • To compare effects of CT with those of other non‐pharmacological interventions, including cognitive stimulation or rehabilitation, for people with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers. • To identify and explore factors related to intervention and trial design that may be associated with the efficacy of CT for people with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, on 5 July 2018. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified through monthly searches of several major healthcare databases and numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. In addition to this, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's trials portal, ICTRP, to ensure that searches were comprehensive and up‐to‐date. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that described interventions for people with mild to moderate dementia and compared CT versus a control or alternative intervention. Data collection and analysis We extracted relevant data from published manuscripts and through contact with trial authors if required. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We divided comparison conditions into active or passive control conditions and alternative treatments. We used a large number of measures and data to evaluate 19 outcomes at end of treatment, as well as 16 outcomes at follow‐up in the medium term; we pooled this information in meta‐analyses. We calculated pooled estimates of treatment effect using a random‐effects model, and we estimated statistical heterogeneity using a standard Chi² statistic. We graded the evidence using GradePro. Main results The 33 included trials were published between 1988 and 2018 and were conducted in 12 countries; most were unregistered, parallel‐group, single‐site RCTs, with samples ranging from 12 to 653 participants. Interventions were between two and 104 weeks long. We classified most experimental interventions as 'straight CT', but we classified some as 'augmented CT', and about two‐thirds as multi‐domain interventions. Researchers investigated 18 passive and 13 active control conditions, along with 15 alternative treatment conditions, including occupational therapy, mindfulness, reminiscence therapy, and others. The methodological quality of studies varied, but we rated nearly all studies as having high or unclear risk of selection bias due to lack of allocation concealment, and high or unclear risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding of participants and personnel. We used data from 32 studies in the meta‐analysis of at least one outcome. Relative to a control condition, we found moderate‐quality evidence showing a small to moderate effect of CT on our first primary outcome, composite measure of global cognition at end of treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.62), and high‐quality evidence showing a moderate effect on the secondary outcome of verbal semantic fluency (SMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.81) at end of treatment, with these gains retained in the medium term (3 to 12 months post treatment). In relation to many other outcomes, including our second primary outcome of clinical disease severity in the medium term, the quality of evidence was very low, so we were unable to determine whether CT was associated with any meaningful gains. When compared with an alternative treatment, we found that CT may have little to no effect on our first primary outcome of global cognition at end of treatment (SMD 0.21, 95% CI ‐0.23 to 0.64), but the quality of evidence was low. No evidence was available to assess our second primary outcome of clinical disease severity in the medium term. We found moderate‐quality evidence showing that CT was associated with improved mood of the caregiver at end of treatment, but this was based on a single trial. The quality of evidence in relation to many other outcomes at end of treatment and in the medium term was too low for us to determine whether CT was associated with any gains, but we are moderately confident that CT did not lead to any gains in mood, behavioural and psychological symptoms, or capacity to perform activities of daily living. Authors' conclusions Relative to a control intervention, but not to a variety of alternative treatments, CT is probably associated with small to moderate positive effects on global cognition and verbal semantic fluency at end of treatment, and these benefits appear to be maintained in the medium term. Our certainty in relation to many of these findings is low or very low. Future studies should take stronger measures to mitigate well‐established risks of bias, and should provide long‐term follow‐up to improve our understanding of the extent to which observed gains are retained. Future trials should also focus on direct comparison of CT versus alternative treatments rather than passive or active control conditions. Plain language summary Cognitive training for people with mild to moderate dementia Background Dementia due to Alzheimer’s and other diseases is a leading cause of disability and an enormous health and societal problem. More than 40 million people in the world currently live with dementia, and this number is expected to increase to more than 115 million by the year 2050. Effective treatments to reduce the burden of dementia are urgently needed. Cognitive training (CT) is a non‐pharmacological form of treatment that focuses on guided practice on tasks that target specific cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, or problem‐solving. Whether CT can help people with mild to moderate dementia maintain or improve their thinking, well‐being, and general functioning remains unclear. Main findings We analysed data from 33 studies of CT that included a total of approximately 2000 participants and were conducted in 12 countries. We found that, compared with receiving usual treatment or engaging in non‐specific activities, people completing CT may show some benefits in overall cognition, as well as in more specific cognitive abilities such as verbal fluency, and that improvements may last for at least a few months. We did not find any evidence that participating in CT was associated with increased burden for participants. However, we also found no evidence that CT was better than participating in other active treatments. Limitations of this review The quality of the studies we reviewed varied but overall was not very high, so our certainty in some of these findings is low. Future studies should continue improving on quality, should continue comparing CT with other treatments, and should follow participants for a longer period to understand whether observed benefits for cognition last beyond the short or medium term.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Although vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia globally, evidence‐based treatments are still lacking. Cerebrolysin is a porcine brain‐derived preparation that is said to have neurotrophic and neuroprotective activity. In many parts of the world Cerebrolysin, given as a series of daily intravenous infusions, is used as a potential intervention for vascular dementia. A previous Cochrane Review on Cerebrolysin in vascular dementia yielded inconsistent results. We wished to update the review to add new studies from the international literature and employ contemporary methods for appraising the strength of the evidence. This is the first update of a review first published in 2013. Objectives Primary: to assess the effect of Cerebrolysin on cognitive function, global function, and all‐cause mortality in people living with vascular dementia. Secondary: to assess the adverse effects of Cerebrolysin and to assess the effect of Cerebrolysin on quality of life and caregiver burden. Search methods We searched ALOIS, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ISI Web of Knowledge, LILACS, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP on 16 June 2017, 9 May 2018, and 9 May 2019. We expanded the search by adding four Chinese databases, searched from 1 January 2012 to 19 May 2019. We checked bibliographies of relevant papers identified and contacted pharmaceutical companies, trial authors, and experts in the field to identify any additional published or unpublished data. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials of Cerebrolysin used in people living with vascular dementia. We applied no language restriction. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and evaluated their methodological quality. Data were extracted and analysed using mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for continuous outcomes. We reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. We assessed the strength of the available evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We identified six randomised controlled trials with a total of 597 participants that were eligible for inclusion in the 2013 review. No new studies were eligible for inclusion in this update. Participants in the included studies, where dementia severity was reported, had mild to moderate severity of vascular dementia (four trials). The included studies tested varying doses and duration of Cerebrolysin treatment. Follow‐up ranged from 15 days to three years. Five of included studies were conducted in China (three studies), Russia (one study), and Romania (one study), while relevant information of other study was unclear. Where details of funding were available, all studies were supported by the pharmaceutical industry (three studies). Cognitive function was measured using the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subpart, extended version (ADAS‐cog+). Combining the MMSE and ADAS‐cog+ data (three studies, 420 people), there was a beneficial effect of Cerebrolysin (SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.58; very low‐quality evidence). Global function was measured by Clinician's Interview‐Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC+) or Investigator's Clinical Global Impression (CGI). We assessed response rates on these measures (the proportion of participants with a CIBIC+ score of < 3; or at least moderate improvement of the CGI rating at the last visit). There was a beneficial effect of Cerebrolysin (two studies, 379 participants, RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.82 to 3.98; very low‐quality evidence). Only one trial described mortality and reported no deaths. Four studies reported adverse events; data from two studies (379 people) were in a format that permitted meta‐analysis, and there was no difference in rates of adverse effects (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.85; very low‐quality evidence). No studies reported on quality of life or caregiver burden. Authors' conclusions Courses of intravenous Cerebrolysin improved cognition and general function in people living with vascular dementia, with no suggestion of adverse effects. However, these data are not definitive. Our analyses were limited by heterogeneity, and the included papers had high risk of bias. If there are benefits of Cerebrolysin, the effects may be too small to be clinically meaningful. There have been no new studies of Cerebrolysin in vascular dementia since the last Cochrane Review. Cerebrolysin continues to be used and promoted as a treatment for vascular dementia, but the supporting evidence base is weak. Adequately powered, methodologically robust trials are needed to properly assess the effects of Cerebrolysin in vascular dementia. Plain language summary Cerebrolysin for vascular dementia Background Vascular dementia is a common form of dementia caused by poor blood flow to the brain. There are currently no proven and licenced treatments for vascular dementia. Cerebrolysin is a medicine that is made from pig's brains and given as an injection. In some countries, Cerebrolysin is used as a treatment for vascular dementia. A previous summary from 2013 considered all studies of Cerebrolysin and vascular dementia. A definitive conclusion as to whether Cerebrolysin was beneficial could not be made. Purpose of this review We wanted to learn whether Cerebrolysin can benefit people living with vascular dementia. We were particularly interested in the effects of the medication on memory and thinking; daily functioning; side effects; and and quality of life for people with vascular dementia and their caregivers. As some time has passed since the last review of Cerebrolysin, we wanted to update the review with a search for any new studies. What we did We searched for studies that described the effect of Cerebrolysin in people living with vascular dementia. We searched databases of scientific studies, including resources from countries where Cerebrolysin is commonly used. To be included in our review, the studies had to randomly decide whether people were treated with Cerebrolysin or a comparison. We combined the results of the included studies to estimate the effect of Cerebrolysin. We also assessed how well the studies were conducted and how credible the results were. The evidence is current to May 2019. What we found We found six studies including a total of 597 people living with vascular dementia. The method of Cerebrolysin treatment differed across studies, with varying strengths of Cerebrolysin and treatment durations. The studies reported that Cerebrolysin had beneficial effects on memory and thinking and on daily functioning. There was no reported risk of side effects with treatment. None of the studies described quality of life of people living with vascular dementia or their caregivers. Although the studies suggested a benefit of Cerebrolysin treatment, the results are not definitive. The included studies had several issues that may have led to misleading results. Even if the benefit reported in the studies is real, the effect was modest and may not be important to people living with dementia. There is a need for a large, well‐conducted study to better understand if Cerebrolysin is a useful treatment for people living with vascular dementia.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background People with central neurological disease or injury have a much higher risk of both faecal incontinence (FI) and constipation than the general population. There is often a fine line between the two symptoms, with management intended to ameliorate one risking precipitating the other. Bowel problems are observed to be the cause of much anxiety and may reduce quality of life in these people. Current bowel management is largely empirical, with a limited research base. The review is relevant to individuals with any disease directly and chronically affecting the central nervous system (post‐traumatic, degenerative, ischaemic or neoplastic), such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2001 and subsequently updated in 2003, 2006 and 2014. Objectives To assess the effects of conservative, physical and surgical interventions for managing FI and constipation in people with a neurological disease or injury affecting the central nervous system. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (searched 27 March 2023), which includes searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In‐Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP as well as handsearching of journals and conference proceedings; and all reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria We included randomised, quasi‐randomised (where allocation is not strictly random), cross‐over and cluster‐randomised trials evaluating any type of conservative, physical or surgical intervention against placebo, usual care or no intervention for the management of FI and constipation in people with central neurological disease or injury. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in eligible trials using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool and independently extracted data from the included trials using a range of prespecified outcome measures. We produced summary of findings tables for our main outcome measures and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included 25 studies with 1598 participants. The studies were generally at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding of participants and personnel to the intervention. Half of the included studies were also at high risk of bias in terms of selective reporting. Outcomes were often reported heterogeneously across studies, making it difficult to pool data. We did not find enough evidence to be able to analyse the effects of interventions on individual central neurological diseases. Additionally, very few studies reported on the primary outcomes of self‐reported improvement in FI or constipation, or Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score. Conservative interventions compared with usual care, no active treatment or placebo Thirteen studies assessed this comparison. The interventions included assessment‐based nursing, holistic nursing, probiotics, psyllium, faecal microbiota transplantation, and a stepwise protocol of increasingly invasive evacuation methods. Conservative interventions may result in a large improvement in faecal incontinence (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐1.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.47 to ‐0.23; 3 studies; n = 410; low‐certainty evidence). We interpreted SMD ≥ 0.80 as a large effect. It was not possible to pool all data from studies that assessed improvement in constipation, but the evidence suggested that conservative interventions may improve constipation symptoms (data not pooled; 8 studies; n = 612; low‐certainty evidence). Conservative interventions may lead to a reduction in mean time taken on bowel care (data not pooled; 5 studies; n = 526; low‐certainty evidence). The evidence is uncertain about the effects of conservative interventions on condition‐specific quality of life and adverse events. Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score was not reported. Physical therapy compared with usual care, no active treatment or placebo Twelve studies assessed this comparison. The interventions included massage therapy, standing, osteopathic manipulative treatment, electrical stimulation, transanal irrigation, and conventional physical therapy with visceral mobilisation. Physical therapies may make little to no difference to self‐reported faecal continence assessed using the St Mark's Faecal Incontinence Score, where the minimally important difference is five, or the Cleveland Constipation Score (MD ‐2.60, 95% CI ‐4.91 to ‐0.29; 3 studies; n = 155; low‐certainty evidence). Physical therapies may result in a moderate improvement in constipation symptoms (SMD ‐0.62, 95% CI ‐1.10 to ‐0.14; 9 studies; n = 431; low‐certainty evidence). We interpreted SMD ≥ 0.5 as a moderate effect. However, physical therapies may make little to no difference in Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score as the minimally important difference for this tool is 3 (MD ‐1.94, 95% CI ‐3.36 to ‐0.51; 7 studies; n = 358; low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effects of physical therapies on the time spent on bowel care, condition‐specific quality of life and adverse effects (all very low‐certainty evidence). Surgical interventions compared with usual care, no active treatment or placebo No studies were found for surgical interventions that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Authors' conclusions There remains little research on this common and, for patients, very significant issue of bowel management. The available evidence is almost uniformly of low methodological quality. The clinical significance of some of the research findings presented here is difficult to interpret, not least because each intervention has only been addressed in individual trials, against control rather than compared against each other, and the interventions are very different from each other. Understanding whether there is a clinically‐meaningful difference from the results of available trials is largely hampered by the lack of uniform outcome measures. This is due to an absence of core outcome sets, and development of these needs to be a research priority to allow studies to be compared directly. Some studies used validated constipation, incontinence or condition‐specific measures; however, others used unvalidated analogue scales to report effectiveness. Some studies did not use any patient‐reported outcomes and focused on physiological outcome measures, which is of relatively limited significance in terms of clinical implementation. There was evidence in favour of some conservative interventions, but these findings need to be confirmed by larger, well‐designed controlled trials, which should include evaluation of the acceptability of the intervention to patients and the effect on their quality of life. Plain language summary What are the benefits and harms of different non‐pharmacological treatments for managing constipation and faecal incontinence in people with a central neurological disease? Key messages ‐ In people with central neurological diseases, some non‐drug treatments, such as probiotics and abdominal massage, may improve self‐reported symptoms of constipation, while others, such as holistic nursing assessment, may improve self‐reported symptoms of faecal incontinence (FI). ‐ The evidence is very uncertain whether some non‐drug treatments (probiotics and nursing assessment) have any effect on people’s quality of life, the time they need to spend on bowel care, or their risk of harmful or unwanted effects from the treatment. ‐ Further research, including specific core outcome measures, is needed in this area. The development of outcome measures needs to depend upon the key quality of life symptoms that are important to this group of individuals. How do constipation and FI affect people with central neurological diseases? People with central neurological diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis and stroke, often suffer from bowel problems. These include constipation and FI, with some people experiencing both conditions. It can be very difficult to manage constipation without causing faecal leakage or stop it without causing constipation. People with central neurological diseases often need to spend more time emptying their bowels, which can cause great anxiety, distress and reduce their quality of life. How are constipation and FI managed in people with central neurological diseases? Constipation and FI in people with central neurological diseases can be managed in several ways. Non‐drug options for bowel management include conservative treatments, such as making dietary modifications (e.g. taking probiotics or prebiotics). Physical therapies include exercise, massaging the area around the belly, or using water to clear the bowel of faeces. Surgery is also a non‐drug treatment option. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out how effective non‐drug interventions were for treating people with constipation, FI, or both, as a result of a central neurological disease. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated conservative management options, physical therapies or surgery compared with either no treatment, usual care (care delivered at home or in a hospital by a healthcare professional) or “dummy” treatments that do not contain any medicine in people with constipation, FI, or both, as a result of having a central neurological disease. We compared and summarised the results of these studies and rated our confidence in those results, based on factors such as the study methods and their size. What did we find? We found 25 studies involving 1598 people with a central neurological disease and either constipation, FI, or both. Eight studies included people with Parkinson's disease, seven included people with spinal cord injury, five included people with stroke, two included participants with multiple sclerosis, one with participants with spina bifida, one with people with dementia and one included people with severe learning disabilities. Nearly all the studies took place in high‐income countries. Two of the included studies were sponsored by industry and three did not report funding sources. One study declared that the authors had received no financial support. The remaining studies were funded either by research grants, hospitals or local authorities, charities, or non‐profit organisations. Main results We found 13 studies comparing conservative management options with usual care, no active treatment or placebo. Conservative management options may result in a large reduction in self‐reported faecal incontinence symptoms, and they may also improve constipation symptoms. Additionally, conservative interventions may lead to a reduction in the average time taken on bowel care. However, the evidence is very uncertain whether conservative interventions are effective in improving people’s condition‐specific well‐being, or how many side effects these treatments might lead to. None of the studies reported on the Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score, a tool used to measure bowel dysfunction in people with central neurological diseases. We found 12 studies that compared physical therapies to usual care, no active treatment or placebo. Physical therapies may make little to no difference in symptoms of faecal incontinence but may lead to a moderate improvement in constipation. However, physical therapies may make little to no difference to the Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score. The evidence is very uncertain whether physical therapies are effective in improving people’s condition‐specific well‐being, the amount of time they need to spend on bowel care or how many side effects these treatments might lead to. What are the limitations of the evidence? Generally, we have little confidence in the evidence because of how studies were conducted. In many studies, it was possible for people to know what treatment they were getting, which may have affected results, and many studies had issues with the way they reported results. Additionally, studies often had very few people participating in them. There is a lack of uniform measurements within the research that would allow different pieces of research to be compared and information on the potential side effects of these treatments was very limited. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up to date to 27 March 2023.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) describes a broad spectrum of cognitive impairments caused by cerebrovascular disease, ranging from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. There are currently no pharmacological treatments recommended for improving either cognition or function in people with VCI. Three cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) are licenced for the treatment of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. They are thought to work by compensating for reduced cholinergic neurotransmission, which is also a feature of VCI. Through pairwise comparisons with placebo and a network meta‐analysis, we sought to determine whether these medications are effective in VCI and whether there are differences between them with regard to efficacy or adverse events. Objectives (1) To assess the efficacy and safety of cholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of adults with vascular dementia and other VCI. (2) To compare the effects of different cholinesterase inhibitors on cognition and adverse events, using network meta‐analysis. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 19 August 2020. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials in which donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine was compared with placebo or in which the drugs were compared with each other in adults with vascular dementia or other VCI (excluding cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)). We included all drug doses and routes of administration. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently identified eligible trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and applied the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. The primary outcomes were cognition, clinical global impression, function (performance of activities of daily living), and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, incidence of development of new dementia, behavioural disturbance, carer burden, institutionalisation, quality of life and death. For the pairwise analyses, we pooled outcome data at similar time points using random‐effects methods. We also performed a network meta‐analysis using Bayesian methods. Main results We included eight trials (4373 participants) in the review. Three trials studied donepezil 5 mg or 10 mg daily (n= 2193); three trials studied rivastigmine at a maximum daily dose of 3 to 12 mg (n= 800); and two trials studied galantamine at a maximum daily dose of 16 to 24 mg (n= 1380). The trials included participants with possible or probable vascular dementia or cognitive impairment following stroke. Mean ages were between 72.2 and 73.9 years. All of the trials were at low or unclear risk of bias in all domains, and the evidence ranged from very low to high level of certainty. For cognition, the results showed that donepezil 5 mg improves cognition slightly, although the size of the effect is unlikely to be clinically important (mean difference (MD) −0.92 Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale‐Cognitive Subscale (ADAS‐Cog) points (range 0 to 70), 95% confidence interval (CI) −1.44 to −0.40; high‐certainty evidence). Donepezil 10 mg (MD −2.21 ADAS‐Cog points, 95% CI −3.07 to −1.35; moderate‐certainty evidence) and galantamine 16 to 24 mg (MD −2.01 ADAS‐Cog point, 95%CI −3.18 to −0.85; moderate‐certainty evidence) probably also improve cognition, although the larger effect estimates still may not be clinically important. With low certainty, there may be little to no effect of rivastigmine 3 to 12 mg daily on cognition (MD 0.03 ADAS‐Cog points, 95% CI −3.04 to 3.10; low‐certainty evidence). Adverse events reported in the studies included nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness, headache, and hypertension. The results showed that there was probably little to no difference between donepezil 5 mg and placebo in the number of adverse events (odds ratio (OR) 1.22, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.58; moderate‐certainty evidence), but there were slightly more adverse events with donepezil 10 mg than with placebo (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.15; high‐certainty evidence). The effect of rivastigmine 3 to 12 mg on adverse events was very uncertain (OR 3.21, 95% CI 0.36 to 28.88; very low‐certainty evidence). Galantamine 16 to 24 mg is probably associated with a slight excess of adverse events over placebo (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.43; moderate‐certainty evidence). In the network meta‐analysis (NMA), we included cognition to represent benefit, and adverse events to represent harm. All drugs ranked above placebo for cognition and below placebo for adverse events. We found donepezil 10 mg to rank first in terms of benefit, but third in terms of harms, when considering the network estimates and quality of evidence. Galantamine was ranked second in terms of both benefit and harm. Rivastigmine had the lowest ranking of the cholinesterase inhibitors in both benefit and harm NMA estimates, but this may reflect possibly inadequate doses received by some trial participants and small trial sample sizes. Authors' conclusions We found moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence that donepezil 5 mg, donepezil 10 mg, and galantamine have a slight beneficial effect on cognition in people with VCI, although the size of the change is unlikely to be clinically important. Donepezil 10 mg and galantamine 16 to 24 mg are probably associated with more adverse events than placebo. The evidence for rivastigmine was less certain. The data suggest that donepezil 10 mg has the greatest effect on cognition, but at the cost of adverse effects. The effect is modest, but in the absence of any other treatments, people living with VCI may still wish to consider the use of these agents. Further research into rivastigmine is needed, including the use of transdermal patches. Plain language summary Medicines to treat people with vascular dementia and other vascular cognitive impairments Review question What is the evidence for cholinesterase inhibitors (medicines designed to improve memory and thinking in people with dementia), when used with people who have vascular dementia? Background Vascular dementia (or vascular cognitive impairment) is a term used when a person has problems with memory and thinking that are caused by a disruption of blood supply. There are few drug treatments for vascular dementia. In this review, we evaluated three drugs from the cholinesterase inhibitor family, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine. These medications are widely used in Alzheimer's dementia but may also be useful in people with vascular dementia. Previous reviews of these cholinesterase inhibitor drugs could not draw definitive conclusions for people with vascular dementia. Purpose of this review We wanted to learn whether cholinesterase inhibitors benefit people with vascular dementia. We were interested in their effects on memory, thinking, and daily functioning. We wanted to learn of any harms associated with these drugs. As some time has passed since the previous reviews, we wanted to update them by searching for new studies. We combined the three previous reviews on donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine into one review. What we did We searched for studies that described the effects of donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine for people with vascular dementia. We searched databases of scientific studies and contacted drug manufacturers and experts in vascular dementia. Our search is current to 19 August 2020. To be included in our review, studies had to randomly assign people with vascular dementia to treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor, or a dummy pill (placebo) and then compare the two groups. Studies comparing one cholinesterase inhibitor against another were also included. We combined the results of the included studies for each medicine to estimate how effective they were and how likely they were to cause side effects. We assessed how well the studies were conducted and how credible the results were. We did not find studies which compared different cholinesterase inhibitors with each other. To see whether the different cholinesterase inhibitor drugs differed in their effects, we used a technique called network meta‐analysis, which can provide an idea of how the medicines might perform if they were compared head‐to‐head. What we found We found 8 studies including a total of 4373 people with vascular dementia (or vascular cognitive impairment). The studies tested the drug donepezil at two different doses (5mg and 10mg daily), against each other and against placebo. Rivastigmine and galantamine were tested against placebo only. Rivastigmine is available as a skin patch, but the studies only tested the pill version. All eight studies evaluated participants when they first started taking the medicine or placebo and again six months later. Different tests were used to measure the effects. All studies included tests of memory, thinking and reported side effects. People taking donepezil or galantamine had better scores on memory and thinking tests than people taking placebo, but the benefits were modest and may not be large enough to be evident in daily life. There was no evidence of a difference for rivastigmine, but the evidence was less certain, and the doses taken by some participants may have been too low to show an effect. We found evidence that when compared to placebo, side effects such as nausea and diarrhoea, were more common in people taking donepezil 10mg and galantamine, but probably not donepezil 5mg. We were unable to draw conclusions about side effects of rivastigmine from the studies. No vascular dementia trials comparing the different cholinesterase against each other have been conducted. Using the information from the individual studies, we made indirect assessments of how the drugs would perform if tested head‐to‐head. The results suggested that donepezil 10 mg had the greatest effect on memory and thinking, but caused more side effects than donepezil 5 mg or galantamine. There were only a small number of studies for each drug. Certainty in the results varied between drugs and between outcomes, from high to very low certainty. The studies showed only a small benefit at most; however, in the absence of any other treatments, people living with dementia may still wish to consider use of these drugs.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by impairments in social communication and interaction, plus restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour and interests. Whilst some people embrace autism as part of their identity, others struggle with their difficulties, and some seek treatment. There are no current interventions that result in complete reduction of autism features. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter for the cholinergic system and has a role in attention, novelty seeking, and memory. Low levels of acetylcholine have been investigated as a potential contributor to autism symptomatology. Donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine (commonly referred to as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) all inhibit acetylcholinesterase, and have slightly different modes of action and biological availability, so their effectiveness and side‐effect profiles may vary. The effect of various acetylcholinesterase inhibitor on core autism features across the lifespan, and possible adverse effects, have not been thoroughly investigated. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and harms of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for people with the core features (social interaction, communication, and restrictive and repetitive behaviours) of autism. To assess the effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on non‐core features of autism. Search methods In November 2022, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases, and two trials registers. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews, and contacted authors of relevant studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), comparing acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. galantamine, donepezil, or rivastigmine) of varying doses, delivered orally or via transdermal patch, either as monotherapy or adjunct therapy, with placebo. People of any age, with a clinical diagnosis of autism were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were core features of autism and adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were language, irritability, hyperactivity, and general health and function. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Main results We included two RCTs (74 participants). One study was conducted in Iran, the second in the USA, although exact location in the USA is unclear. Galantamine plus risperidone versus placebo plus risperidone One study compared the effects of galantamine plus risperidone to placebo plus risperidone (40 participants, aged 4 years to 12 years). Primary and secondary outcomes of interest were measured postintervention, using subscales of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (score 0 to 3; higher scores = greater impairment). Very low‐certainty evidence showed there was little to no difference between the two groups postintervention for social communication (mean difference (MD) ‐2.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐5.88 to 0.38), and restricted and repetitive behaviour (MD ‐0.55, 95% CI ‐3.47 to 2.37). Overall autism features were not assessed. Adverse events may be higher in the galantamine plus risperidone group (75%) compared with the placebo plus risperidone group (35%): odds ratio 5.57, 95% CI 1.42 to 21.86, low‐certainty evidence. No serious adverse events were reported. Low‐certainty evidence showed a small difference in irritability (MD ‐3.50, 95% CI ‐6.39 to ‐0.61), with the galantamine plus risperidone group showing a greater decline on the irritability subscale than the placebo group postintervention. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in hyperactivity postintervention (MD ‐5.20, 95% CI ‐10.51 to 0.11). General health and function were not assessed. Donepezil versus placebo One study compared donepezil to placebo (34 participants aged 8 years to 17 years). Primary outcomes of interest were measured postintervention, using subscales of the Modified Version of The Real Life Rating Scale (scored 0 to 3; higher scores = greater impairment). Very low‐certainty evidence showed no evidence of group differences immediately postintervention in overall autism features (MD 0.07, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.33), or in the autism symptom domains of social communication (MD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.34 to 0.30), and restricted and repetitive behaviours (MD 0.04, 95% CI ‐0.27 to 0.35). Significant adverse events leading to study withdrawal in at least one participant was implied in the data analysis section, but not explicitly reported. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of donepezil, compared to placebo, on the secondary outcomes of interest, including irritability (MD 1.08, 95% CI ‐0.41 to 2.57), hyperactivity (MD 2.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.70), and general health and function (MD 0.03, 95% CI ‐0.48 to 0.54) postintervention. Across all analyses within this comparison, we judged the evidence to be very low‐certainty due to high risk of bias, and very serious imprecision (results based on one small study with wide confidence intervals). The study narratively reported adverse events for the study as a whole, rather than by treatment group. Authors' conclusions Evidence about the effectiveness of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as a medication to improve outcomes for autistic adults is lacking, and for autistic children is very uncertain. There is a need for more evidence of improvement in outcomes of relevance to clinical care, autistic people, and their families. There are a number of ongoing studies involving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and future updates of this review may add to the current evidence. Plain language summary Do acetylcholinesterase inhibitors reduce the core impairments associated with autism spectrum disorder Key messages At present, it is unclear whether acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are effective in treating the core features of autism. This is because very few studies have been carried out. The two we found were small, and did not report the outcomes very well. However, there are a number of ongoing studies in this area. What is autism spectrum disorder? Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a condition that affects the way a person thinks, feels, interacts with others, and experiences their environment. The core behaviours of autism include reduced sharing of interests, difficulties with nonverbal communication (for example, little eye contact), difficulties forming and maintaining relationships and restricted, or repetitive behaviours or interests. These behaviours can vary in severity, but they still interfere with the person's daily functioning and participation in activities. Medicines, called acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (chemicals that block the normal breakdown of nerve transmitters), have been used to treat Alzheimer's disease (for example, donepezil and galantamine). Recently, it has been suggested that they may also decrease some of the difficulties seen in people with autism. What did we want to find out? Do acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, alone or with other medicines, reduce the core features of autism (social communication and interaction, restrictive and repetitive behaviours) compared with a placebo (a dummy pill). We also wanted to find out if acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were associated with any unwanted side effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that explored whether there were any differences in autistic people's behaviours after they had taken acetylcholinesterase inhibitors compared to people who had taken placebo pills. We compared and summarised the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on things, such how big and well carried out the studies were. What did we find? We found two relevant studies. One study looked at whether an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor called galantamine, combined with a drug called risperidone (traditionally used to treat psychosis), was better than a placebo combined with risperidone. The study included 40 children, aged between 4 and 12 years, with a diagnosis of autism. it took place over 10 weeks in Iran. A second study compared an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor called donepezil with placebo. It included 34 children, aged between 8 and 17 years, with a diagnosis of autism. It was carried out in the USA. All studies involved children attending outpatient clinics. What are the main results of the review? It is unclear if acetylcholinesterase inhibitors make any difference to the core features of autism in children or adults. Galantamine may cause little to no difference in social interaction and communication skills and irritability levels in children with autism after 10 weeks of treatment. There is no evidence that galantamine reduces difficulties associated with restricted or repetitive behaviours or hyperactivity. Galantamine may also cause some side effects, including nervousness, drowsiness, increased appetite, and tremor. There is no evidence that donepezil reduces difficulties associated with the core features of autism or associated secondary problems. We were unable to find out whether it causes unwanted side effects in children with autism, because the study did not report the results completely. What are the limitations of the evidence? We have little confidence in the evidence for using this medicine to treat problems associated with autism, because the evidence comes from only two small studies that were not very well carried out or reported. Each study looked at a different type of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and delivered the medicine differently. They did not provide information about all the issues we were interested in, and they measured the side effects differently. If more studies are included in future reviews, these results may change. How up‐to‐date is this review? The evidence in this review is current to November 2022.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Vitamins and minerals have many functions in the nervous system which are important for brain health. It has been suggested that various different vitamin and mineral supplements might be useful in maintaining cognitive function and delaying the onset of dementia. In this review, we sought to examine the evidence for this in people who already had mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Objectives To evaluate the effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on cognitive function and the incidence of dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s (CDCIG) specialised register, as well as MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, CINAHL, LILACs, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP, from inception to 25 January 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasi‐randomised, placebo‐controlled trials which evaluated orally administered vitamin or mineral supplements in participants with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and which assessed the incidence of dementia or cognitive outcomes, or both. We were interested in studies applicable to the general population of older people and therefore excluded studies in which participants had severe vitamin or mineral deficiencies. Data collection and analysis We sought data on our primary outcomes of dementia incidence and overall cognitive function and on secondary outcomes of episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, quality of life, functional performance, clinical global impression, adverse events, and mortality. We conducted data collection and analysis according to standard Cochrane systematic review methods. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We grouped vitamins and minerals according to their putative mechanism of action and, where we considered it to be clinically appropriate, we pooled data using random‐effects methods. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of evidence for each comparison and outcome. Main results We included five trials with 879 participants which investigated B vitamin supplements. In four trials, the intervention was a combination of vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid; in one, it was folic acid only. Doses varied. We considered there to be some risks of performance and attrition bias and of selective outcome reporting among these trials. Our primary efficacy outcomes were the incidence of dementia and scores on measures of overall cognitive function. None of the trials reported the incidence of dementia and the evidence on overall cognitive function was of very low‐quality. There was probably little or no effect of B vitamins taken for six to 24 months on episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, or quality of life. The evidence on our other secondary clinical outcomes, including harms, was very sparse or very low‐quality. There was evidence from one study that there may be a slower rate of brain atrophy over two years in participants taking B vitamins. The same study reported subgroup analyses based on the level of serum homocysteine (tHcy) at baseline and found evidence that B vitamins may improve episodic memory in those with tHcy above the median at baseline. We included one trial (n = 516) of vitamin E supplementation. Vitamin E was given as 1000 IU of alpha‐tocopherol twice daily. We considered this trial to be at risk of attrition and selective reporting bias. There was probably no effect of vitamin E on the probability of progression from MCI to Alzheimer's dementia over three years (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.41; n = 516; 1 study, moderate‐quality evidence). There was also no evidence of an effect at intermediate time points. The available data did not allow us to conduct analyses, but the authors reported no significant effect of three years of supplementation with vitamin E on overall cognitive function, episodic memory, speed of processing, clinical global impression, functional performance, adverse events, or mortality (five deaths in each group). We considered this to be low‐quality evidence. We included one trial (n = 256) of combined vitamin E and vitamin C supplementation and one trial (n = 26) of supplementation with chromium picolinate. In both cases, there was a single eligible cognitive outcome, but we considered the evidence to be very low‐quality and so could not be sure of any effects. Authors' conclusions The evidence on vitamin and mineral supplements as treatments for MCI is very limited. Three years of treatment with high‐dose vitamin E probably does not reduce the risk of progression to dementia, but we have no data on this outcome for other supplements. Only B vitamins have been assessed in more than one RCT. There is no evidence for beneficial effects on cognition of supplementation with B vitamins for six to 24 months. Evidence from a single study of a reduced rate of brain atrophy in participants taking vitamin B and a beneficial effect of vitamin B on episodic memory in those with higher tHcy at baseline warrants attempted replication. Plain language summary Vitamin and mineral supplementation for preventing dementia or delaying cognitive decline in people with mild cognitive impairment Review question This review investigated whether people with mild cognitive impairment can reduce their risk of developing dementia, or can prevent their memory or other thinking skills from deteriorating further, by taking vitamin or mineral supplements. Background Slight changes in memory and thinking skills are common as people get older. When these changes are worse than can be expected in normal ageing, but are not bad enough to make a person's usual activities difficult to manage, then the person is said to have mild cognitive impairment (MCI). People with MCI are at increased risk of developing dementia in the future. Vitamins and minerals are naturally occurring substances which are needed in the diet to maintain health. They have lots of different functions in the body and many are essential to keep the brain working properly. It has been suggested that supplementing a person's normal diet with extra doses of these vitamins or minerals might help to maintain thinking skills or prevent dementia. Study characteristics We found eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which investigated four different types of vitamin or mineral pills by comparing them to a placebo (a dummy pill). The vitamins tested were B vitamins (vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folic acid), vitamin E, and vitamin E and C given together. The only mineral tested was chromium. Key results and quality of the evidence Vitamin B combination versus placebo Five trials with a total of 879 participants compared B vitamins with placebo. Four used combinations of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folic acid; one small study tested folic acid on its own. None of these studies reported whether or not participants developed dementia. These studies did not find that memory or thinking skills differed between the group of people who took vitamin B supplements and those who took placebo after treatment lasting six months to two years. Our confidence in the results on different tests used in the studies varied from moderate to very low. Two years of vitamin B supplements did seem to help memory in a small subgroup of participants in one study who could be identified by a particular blood test at the start of the trial. One study found that there was probably no effect on participants' quality of life. One study scanned the brains of some participants and reported that B vitamins may slow the rate of brain shrinkage. Harmful effects and deaths were reported in very few participants and we cannot conclude whether or not there are harms from taking these or similar combinations of B vitamins. Vitamin E versus placebo. One study with 516 participants compared a relatively high dose of vitamin E (2000 IU a day) to placebo in people who were also taking a multivitamin containing 15 IU of vitamin E (the daily requirement for vitamin E is approximately 30 IU). The risk of developing dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (the commonest form of dementia) is probably not affected by three years of treatment with high‐dose vitamin E. The quality of the evidence for other outcomes was lower, but there may also be no effect of this dose of vitamin E on specific memory or thinking skills or on how well people could manage their daily activities. Vitamin E and C versus placebo One study with 256 participants compared a combination of vitamins C and E with placebo. It found no effect on overall memory and thinking skills, but we had little confidence in this result because of the quality of the evidence. Chromium picolinate versus placebo Only one very small study with 26 participants investigated the effect of chromium supplements. This study was too small for us to be able to draw any conclusions. Conclusions The amount and quality of research evidence about vitamin and mineral supplements for treating MCI in people without nutritional deficiency is limited. At the moment, it is not possible to identify any supplements which can reduce the risk of people with MCI developing dementia or which can effectively treat their symptoms. More research is needed before we can answer our review question.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Although delirium is typically an acute reversible cognitive impairment, its presence is associated with devastating impact on both short‐term and long‐term outcomes for critically ill patients. Advances in our understanding of the negative impact of delirium on patient outcomes have prompted trials evaluating multiple pharmacological interventions. However, considerable uncertainty surrounds the relative benefits and safety of available pharmacological interventions for this population. Objectives Primary objective 1. To assess the effects of pharmacological interventions for treatment of delirium on duration of delirium in critically ill adults with confirmed or documented high risk of delirium Secondary objectives To assess the following: 1. effects of pharmacological interventions on delirium‐free and coma‐free days; days with coma; delirium relapse; duration of mechanical ventilation; intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay; mortality; and long‐term outcomes (e.g. cognitive; discharge disposition; health‐related quality of life); and 2. the safety of such treatments for critically ill adult patients. Search methods We searched the following databases from their inception date to 21 March 2019: Ovid MEDLINE®, Ovid MEDLINE® In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Embase Classic+Embase, and PsycINFO using the Ovid platform. We also searched the Cochrane Library on Wiley, the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) ( http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ ), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science. We performed a grey literature search of relevant databases and websites using the resources listed in  Grey Matters  developed by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH). We also searched trial registries and abstracts from annual scientific critical care and delirium society meetings. Selection criteria We sought randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including quasi‐RCTs, of any pharmacological (drug) for treatment of delirium in critically ill adults. The drug intervention was to be compared to another active drug treatment, placebo, or a non‐pharmacological intervention (e.g. mobilization). We did not apply any restrictions in terms of drug class, dose, route of administration, or duration of delirium or drug exposure. We defined critically ill patients as those treated in an ICU of any specialty (e.g. burn, cardiac, medical, surgical, trauma) or high‐dependency unit. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently identified studies from the search results; four review authors (in pairs) performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias independently. We performed data synthesis through pairwise meta‐analysis and network meta‐analysis (NMA). Our hypothetical network structure was designed to be analysed at the drug class level and illustrated a network diagram of 'nodes' (i.e. drug classes) and 'edges' (i.e. comparisons between different drug classes from existing trials), thus describing a treatment network of all possible comparisons between drug classes. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence according to GRADE, as very low, low, moderate, or high. Main results We screened 7674 citations, from which 14 trials with 1844 participants met our inclusion criteria. Ten RCTs were placebo‐controlled, and four reported comparisons of different drugs. Drugs examined in these trials were the following: antipsychotics (n = 10), alpha 2  agonists (n = 3; all dexmedetomidine), statins (n = 2), opioids (n = 1; morphine), serotonin antagonists (n = 1; ondansetron), and cholinesterase (CHE) inhibitors (n = 1; rivastigmine). Only one of these trials consistently used non‐pharmacological interventions that are known to improve patient outcomes in both intervention and control groups. Eleven studies (n = 1153 participants) contributed to analysis of the primary outcome. Results of the NMA showed that the intervention with the smallest ratio of means (RoM) (i.e. most preferred) compared with placebo was the alpha 2  agonist dexmedetomidine (0.58; 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.26 to 1.27; surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) 0.895; moderate‐quality evidence). In order of descending SUCRA values (best to worst), the next best interventions were atypical antipsychotics (RoM 0.80, 95% CrI 0.50 to 1.11; SUCRA 0.738; moderate‐quality evidence), opioids (RoM 0.88, 95% CrI 0.37 to 2.01; SUCRA 0.578; very‐low quality evidence), and typical antipsychotics (RoM 0.96, 95% CrI 0.64 to1.36; SUCRA 0.468; high‐quality evidence). The NMAs of multiple secondary outcomes revealed that only the alpha 2  agonist dexmedetomidine was associated with a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (RoM 0.55, 95% CrI 0.34 to 0.89; moderate‐quality evidence), and the CHE inhibitor rivastigmine was associated with a longer ICU stay (RoM 2.19, 95% CrI 1.47 to 3.27; moderate‐quality evidence). Adverse events often were not reported in these trials or, when reported, were rare; pair‐wise analysis of QTc prolongation in seven studies did not show significant differences between antipsychotics, ondansetron, dexmedetomidine, and placebo. Authors' conclusions We identified trials of varying quality that examined six different drug classes for treatment of delirium in critically ill adults. We found evidence that the alpha 2  agonist dexmedetomidine may shorten delirium duration, although this small effect (compared with placebo) was seen in pairwise analyses based on a single study and was not seen in the NMA results. Alpha 2  agonists also ranked best for duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay, whereas the CHE inhibitor rivastigmine was associated with longer ICU stay. We found no evidence of a difference between placebo and any drug in terms of delirium‐free and coma‐free days, days with coma, physical restraint use, length of stay, long‐term cognitive outcomes, or mortality. No studies reported delirium relapse, resolution of symptoms, or quality of life. The ten ongoing studies and the six studies awaiting classification that we identified, once published and assessed, may alter the conclusions of the review. Plain language summary Medicines to treat delirium in critically ill adult patients Review question We reviewed the evidence from randomized controlled trials for the benefits and safety of all prescription medicines used to treat critically ill adult patients with delirium in the intensive care units (ICUs) of hospitals. Background Delirium is commonly associated with surgery, infection, or critical illness. It is experienced as new‐onset, generally short‐term inability to think clearly. Patients with delirium shift between periods of clear thinking and periods of agitation and/or great sleepiness and confusion. Lack of sleep, pain, a noisy environment, physical restraint, and the use of sedatives and strong analgesics are some of the contributing factors. Delirium affects both immediate and longer‐term health outcomes of critically ill patients as it can increase the length of time a breathing machine is required, time spent in the ICU and in hospital, and the chance of functional weakening and death. The odds of a poor outcome with delirium are increased with frail patients and those of advanced age and already present cognitive difficulties. Frequently, delirious ICU patients are given medicines to help treat symptoms such as agitation. Study characteristics This review is current to 21 March 2019. We found 14 randomized controlled studies that enrolled a total of 1844 adult participants. Six different classes of medicines were tested. These were antipsychotic drugs used as tranquillizers in ten studies; the sedative alpha 2  agonist dexmedetomidine in three studies; statins that reduce cholesterol in two studies; opioids as part of pain management in one study; serotonin antagonists for nausea and vomiting in one study; and cholinesterase inhibitors, which are medicines for Alzheimer's disease, in one study. Ten studies compared medicine to placebo ‐ an inactive medicine also known as a sugar pill; four studies compared different drugs. Eleven studies with 1153 participants reported on the main outcome of this review ‐ duration of delirium. Key findings When drug classes were directly compared with placebo, only the alpha 2  agonist dexmedetomidine was found to reduce the duration of delirium, and the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine was found to prolong the duration of delirium. Each of these results is based on findings from a single small study. The other drugs when compared to placebo did not change delirium duration. The Review authors used the statistical method of network meta‐analysis to compare the six different drug classes. Dexmedetomidine was ranked most effective in reducing delirium duration, followed by atypical antipsychotics. However, network meta‐analysis of delirium duration failed to rule out the possibility of no difference for all six drug classes compared to placebo. Using this method, we did not find that any drug improved the duration of coma, length of stay, long‐term cognitive outcomes, or death. The alpha 2  agonist dexmedetomidine shortened time spent on a breathing machine. Adverse events often were not reported in these trials or were rare when reported. An analysis of reported events showed that events were similar to those reported with placebo. We found 10 ongoing studies and six studies awaiting classification that, once published and assessed, may change the conclusions of this review. Quality of the evidence Most of the included studies were small but of good design. Nine of the 14 studies were considered to have low risk of bias.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) may complicate a patient's postoperative recovery in several ways. Monitoring of processed electroencephalogram (EEG) or evoked potential (EP) indices may prevent or minimize POD and POCD, probably through optimization of anaesthetic doses. Objectives To assess whether the use of processed EEG or auditory evoked potential (AEP) indices (bispectral index (BIS), narcotrend index, cerebral state index, state entropy and response entropy, patient state index, index of consciousness, A‐line autoregressive index, and auditory evoked potentials (AEP index)) as guides to anaesthetic delivery can reduce the risk of POD and POCD in non‐cardiac surgical or non‐neurosurgical adult patients undergoing general anaesthesia compared with standard practice where only clinical signs are used. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trial registry databases up to 28 March 2017. We updated this search in February 2018, but these results have not been incorporated in the review. Selection criteria We included randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing any method of processed EEG or evoked potential techniques (entropy, BIS, AEP etc.) against a control group where clinical signs were used to guide doses of anaesthetics in adults aged 18 years or over undergoing general anaesthesia for non‐cardiac or non‐neurosurgical elective operations. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: occurrence of POD; and occurrence of POCD. Secondary outcomes included: all‐cause mortality; any postoperative complications; and postoperative length of stay. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome. Main results We included six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 2929 participants comparing processed EEG or EP indices‐guided anaesthesia with clinical signs‐guided anaesthesia. There are five ongoing studies and one study awaiting classification. Anaesthesia administration guided by the indices from a processed EEG (bispectral index) probably reduces the risk of POD within seven days after surgery with risk ratio (RR) of 0.71 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 17, 95% CI 11 to 34; 2197 participants; 3 RCTs; moderate quality of evidence). Three trials also showed the lower rate of POCD at 12 weeks after surgery (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.96; NNTB 38, 95% CI 21 to 289; 2051 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), but it is uncertain whether processed EEG indices reduce POCD at one week (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.02; 3 trials; 1989 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), and at 52 weeks (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.80; 1 trial; 59 participants; very low quality of evidence). There may be little or no effect on all‐cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.64; 1 trial; 1155 participants; low‐quality evidence). One trial suggested a lower risk of any postoperative complications with processed EEG (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71; 902 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). There may be little or no effect on reduced postoperative length of stay (mean difference −0.2 days, 95% CI −2.02 to 1.62; 1155 participants; low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions There is moderate‐quality evidence that optimized anaesthesia guided by processed EEG indices could reduce the risk of postoperative delirium in patients aged 60 years or over undergoing non‐cardiac surgical and non‐neurosurgical procedures. We found moderate‐quality evidence that postoperative cognitive dysfunction at three months could be reduced in these patients. The effect on POCD at one week and over one year after surgery is uncertain. There are no data available for patients under 60 years. Further blinded randomized controlled trials are needed to elucidate strategies for the amelioration of postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, and their consequences such as dementia (including Alzheimer's disease (AD)) in both non‐elderly (below 60 years) and elderly (60 years or over) adult patients. The one study awaiting classification and five ongoing studies may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed. Plain language summary Optimized anaesthesia depth guided by brain electrical activity for protection against postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction in adults Review question We wanted to discover whether using brain electrical activity monitoring to guide doses of anaesthetics can reduce the risk of postoperative delirium (POD) and cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in adults undergoing general anaesthesia for non‐cardiac and non‐neurological surgical procedures.  Background Postoperative delirium (POD) is a disturbed state of mind which occurs a few days after surgery. POD involves a fluctuating course of confusion and disorganized behaviour. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a decline in the ability of a person to think clearly after an operation. This may persist for weeks or months. POCD can affect a person's concentration, attention, memory, learning, and the speed of their movement and mental responses. POD and POCD can complicate the quality of a person's recovery from anaesthesia, as well as the quality of their life after surgery. Processed electroencephalogram (EEG) monitors generate numerical values of brain electrical activity. The number provides information about the depth of anaesthesia during surgery, and is used to guide the dose of anaesthetic given. This is to prevent someone receiving either too small or too large a dose of anaesthetics. Search date The evidence is current to March 2017. We found six completed studies, five ongoing studies, and one awaiting classification. Study characteristics All six completed studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT) conducted in 2929 male or female participants undergoing a surgical procedure and aged 60 years or over. An RCT is a study (or trial) which aims to reduce bias when testing a new treatment. The people taking part in the trial are randomly allocated to either the group receiving the treatment under investigation, or to a group receiving standard treatment (or placebo treatment) as the control. RCTs provide the most reliable evidence. Key results Results from three studies (2529 participants) indicate that using the processed EEG to help deliver the optimal depth of anaesthesia could reduce the incidence of POD from 21.3% to 15.2%. Results from three studies (2051 participants) indicate that this could also reduce the incidence of POCD at three months from 9.1% to 6.4%. Quality of the evidence Our review provides moderate‐quality evidence that anaesthesia guided by processed EEG indices could reduce the risk of postoperative delirium in patients aged 60 years or over undergoing non‐cardiac and non‐neurological surgical procedures. We found some moderate‐quality evidence that postoperative cognitive dysfunction at three months could be reduced in these participants. There is insufficient evidence supporting the effect on POCD at one week and over one year after surgery or in younger patients.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Cognitive stimulation (CS) is an intervention for people with dementia offering a range of enjoyable activities providing general stimulation for thinking, concentration and memory, usually in a social setting, such as a small group. CS is distinguished from other approaches such as cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation by its broad focus and social elements, aiming to improve domains such as quality of life (QoL) and mood as well as cognitive function. Recommended in various guidelines and widely implemented internationally, questions remain regarding different modes of delivery and the clinical significance of any benefits. A systematic review of CS is important to clarify its effectiveness and place practice recommendations on a sound evidence base. This review was last updated in 2012. Objectives To evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of CS for people with dementia, including any negative effects, on cognition and other relevant outcomes, accounting where possible for differences in its implementation. Search methods We identified trials from a search of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, last searched on 3 March 2022. We used the search terms: cognitive stimulation, reality orientation, memory therapy, memory groups, memory support, memory stimulation, global stimulation, cognitive psychostimulation. We performed supplementary searches in a number of major healthcare databases and trial registers to ensure the search was up‐to‐date and comprehensive. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CS for dementia published in peer review journals in the English language incorporating a measure of cognitive change. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. As CS is a psychosocial intervention, we did not expect those receiving or delivering CS to be blinded to the nature of the intervention. Where necessary, we contacted study authors requesting data not provided in the papers. Where appropriate, we undertook subgroup analysis by modality (individual versus group), number of sessions and frequency, setting (community versus care home), type of control condition and dementia severity. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of evidence for each outcome. Main results We included 37 RCTs (with 2766 participants), 26 published since the previous update. Most evaluated CS groups; eight examined individual CS. Participants' median age was 79.7 years. Sixteen studies included participants resident in care homes or hospitals. Study quality showed indications of improvement since the previous review, with few areas of high risk of bias. Assessors were clearly blinded to treatment allocation in most studies (81%) and most studies (81%) reported use of a treatment manual by those delivering the intervention. However, in a substantial number of studies (59%), we could not find details on all aspects of the randomisation procedures, leading us to rate the risk of selection bias as unclear. We entered data in the meta‐analyses from 36 studies (2704 participants; CS: 1432, controls: 1272). The primary analysis was on changes evident immediately following the treatment period (median length 10 weeks; range 4 to 52 weeks). Only eight studies provided data allowing evaluation of whether effects were subsequently maintained (four at 6‐ to 12‐week follow‐up; four at 8‐ to 12‐month follow‐up). No negative effects were reported. Overall, we found moderate‐quality evidence for a small benefit in cognition associated with CS (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.40, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.55). In the 25 studies, with 1893 participants, reporting the widely used MMSE (Mini‐Mental State Examination) test for cognitive function in dementia, there was moderate‐quality evidence of a clinically important difference of 1.99 points between CS and controls (95% CI: 1.24, 2.74). In secondary analyses, with smaller total sample sizes, again examining the difference between CS and controls on changes immediately following the intervention period, we found moderate‐quality evidence of a slight improvement in self‐reported QoL (18 studies, 1584 participants; SMD: 0.25 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.42]) as well as in QoL ratings made by proxies (staff or caregivers). We found high‐quality evidence for clinically relevant improvements in staff/interviewer ratings of communication and social interaction (5 studies, 702 participants; SMD: 0.53 [95% CI: 0.36, 0.70]) and for slight benefits in instrumental Activities of Daily Living, self‐reported depressed mood, staff/interviewer‐rated anxiety and general behaviour rating scales. We found moderate‐quality evidence for slight improvements in behaviour that challenges and in basic Activities of Daily Living and low‐quality evidence for a slight improvement in staff/interviewer‐rated depressed mood. A few studies reported a range of outcomes for family caregivers. We found moderate‐quality evidence that overall CS made little or no difference to caregivers' mood or anxiety. We found a high level of inconsistency between studies in relation to both cognitive outcomes and QoL. In exploratory subgroup analyses, we did not identify an effect of modality (group versus individual) or, for group studies, of setting (community versus care home), total number of group sessions or type of control condition (treatment‐as‐usual versus active controls). However, we did find improvements in cognition were larger where group sessions were more frequent (twice weekly or more versus once weekly) and where average severity of dementia among participants at the start of the intervention was 'mild' rather than 'moderate'. Imbalance in numbers of studies and participants between subgroups and residual inconsistency requires these exploratory findings to be interpreted cautiously. Authors' conclusions In this updated review, now with a much more extensive evidence base, we have again identified small, short‐term cognitive benefits for people with mild to moderate dementia participating in CS programmes. From a smaller number of studies, we have also found clinically relevant improvements in communication and social interaction and slight benefits in a range of outcomes including QoL, mood and behaviour that challenges. There are relatively few studies of individual CS, and further research is needed to delineate the effectiveness of different delivery methods (including digital and remote, individual and group) and of multi‐component programmes. We have identified that the frequency of group sessions and level of dementia severity may influence the outcomes of CS, and these aspects should be studied further. There remains an evidence gap in relation to the potential benefits of longer‐term CS programmes and their clinical significance. Plain language summary Can cognitive stimulation benefit people with dementia? Key messages ‐ For people with mild‐to‐moderate dementia, cognitive stimulation probably leads to small benefits in cognition (the general ability to think and remember). ‐ We found a range of other probable benefits, including improved well‐being, mood and day‐to‐day abilities, but benefits were generally slight and, especially for cognition and well‐being, varied greatly between studies. ‐ Most studies evaluated group cognitive stimulation. Future studies should try to clarify the effects of individual cognitive stimulation, assess how often group sessions should take place to have the best effect, and identify who benefits most from cognitive stimulation. What is dementia? Dementia is an umbrella term for numerous brain disorders. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common of these. People of all ages can develop dementia, but most often it occurs in later life. People with dementia typically experience a decline in their cognitive abilities, which can impair memory, thinking, language and practical skills. These problems usually worsen over time and can lead to isolation, upset and distress for the person with dementia and those providing care and support. Cognitive stimulation Cognitive stimulation (CS) is a form of 'mental exercise' developed specifically to help people with dementia. It involves a wide range of activities aiming to stimulate thinking and memory generally, including discussion of past and present events and topics of interest, word games, puzzles, music and creative practical activities. Usually delivered by trained staff working with a small group of people with dementia for around 45 minutes twice‐weekly, it can also be provided on a one‐to‐one basis. Some programmes have trained family carers to provide CS to their relative. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if CS was better for people living with dementia than usual care or unstructured social activities to improve: ‐ cognitive abilities (including memory, thinking and language skills) ‐ well‐being and mood ‐ day‐to‐day abilities ‐ distress and upset for the person with dementia and/or carers We also wanted to find out if family carers experienced any changes associated with the person with dementia receiving CS or if there were any unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that looked at group or individual CS compared with usual care or unstructured social activity in people living with dementia. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 37 studies involving 2766 participants with mild or moderate dementia and an average age of 79 years. The biggest study involved 356 participants, the smallest 13. The studies were conducted in 17 countries from five continents, with most in Europe. Fewer than half (16) included participants living in care homes or hospitals. The length of the trials varied from four weeks to two years. Sessions per week varied from one to six. The overall number of sessions varied from eight to 520. Most studies lasted for around 10 weeks, with around 20 sessions. Most studies offered CS in groups, with just eight examining individual CS. Main results No negative effects were reported. We found that CS probably results in a small benefit to cognition at the end of the course of sessions compared with usual care/unstructured activities. This benefit equates roughly to a six‐month delay in the cognitive decline usually expected in mild‐to‐moderate dementia. We found preliminary evidence suggesting that cognition benefited more when group sessions occurred twice weekly or more (rather than once weekly) and that benefits were greater in studies where participants’ dementia at the outset was of mild severity. We also found that participants improved on measures of communication and social interaction and showed slight benefits in day‐to‐day activities and in their own ratings of their mood. There is probably also a slight improvement in participants’ well‐being and in experiences that are upsetting and distressing for people with dementia and carers. We found CS probably made little or no difference to carers' mood or anxiety. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about differences in results between studies. We cannot be certain of the exact reasons for these differences, but we noted that studies varied in: • the way CS was delivered (individually, in groups, using an app) and the programme of activities included • who delivered the programme (trained professionals, care workers, family carers) • the frequency of sessions (1 per week to 5 per week) • the duration of the programme (from 4 weeks to 1 or 2 years) • the type(s) of dementia with which participants were diagnosed and the severity of the dementia • whether participants lived in care homes and hospitals or in their own homes We were unable to examine as many of these sources of potential difference as would have been desirable because of the relatively small number of studies reflecting each aspect.

abstract = {Abstract - Background People with Down syndrome are vulnerable to developing dementia at an earlier age than the general population. Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline in people with Down syndrome can place a significant burden on both the person with Down syndrome and their family and carers. Various pharmacological interventions, including donepezil, galantamine, memantine and rivastigmine, appear to have some effect in treating cognitive decline in people without Down syndrome, but their effectiveness for those with Down syndrome remains unclear. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of anti‐dementia pharmacological interventions and nutritional supplements for treating cognitive decline in people with Down syndrome. Search methods In January 2015, we searched CENTRAL, ALOIS (the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, seven other databases, and two trials registers. In addition, we checked the references of relevant reviews and studies and contacted study authors, other researchers and relevant drug manufacturers to identify additional studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of anti‐dementia pharmacological interventions or nutritional supplements for adults (aged 18 years and older) with Down syndrome, in which treatment was administered and compared with either placebo or no treatment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included trials and extracted the relevant data. Review authors contacted study authors to obtain missing information where necessary. Main results Only nine studies (427 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review. Four of these (192 participants) assessed the effectiveness of donepezil, two (139 participants) assessed memantine, one (21 participants) assessed simvastatin, one study (35 participants) assessed antioxidants, and one study (40 participants) assessed acetyl‐L‐carnitine. Five studies focused on adults aged 45 to 55 years, while the remaining four studies focused on adults aged 20 to 29 years. Seven studies were conducted in either the USA or UK, one between Norway and the UK, and one in Japan. Follow‐up periods in studies ranged from four weeks to two years. The reviewers judged all included studies to be at low or unclear risk of bias. Analyses indicate that for participants who received donepezil, scores in measures of cognitive functioning (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.27 to 1.13) and measures of behaviour (SMD 0.42, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.89) were similar to those who received placebo. However, participants who received donepezil were significantly more likely to experience an adverse event (odds ratio (OR) 0.32, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.62). The quality of this body of evidence was low. None of the included donepezil studies reported data for carer stress, institutional/home care, or death. For participants who received memantine, scores in measures of cognitive functioning (SMD 0.05, 95% CI ‐0.43 to 0.52), behaviour (SMD ‐0.17, 95% CI ‐0.46 to 0.11), and occurrence of adverse events (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.17) were similar to those who received placebo. The quality of this body of evidence was low. None of the included memantine studies reported data for carer stress, institutional/home care, or death. Due to insufficient data, it was possible to provide a narrative account only of the outcomes for simvastatin, antioxidants, and acetyl‐L‐carnitine. Results from one pilot study suggest that participants who received simvastatin may have shown a slight improvement in cognitive measures. Authors' conclusions Due to the low quality of the body of evidence in this review, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of any pharmacological intervention for cognitive decline in people with Down syndrome. Plain language summary Medications for cognitive decline in people with Down syndrome People with Down syndrome often experience cognitive decline (a deterioration in memory, language, thinking and judgment that are greater than normal age‐related changes) at a younger age and in greater numbers than the general population. Various medicines have been shown to improve, or at least slow down the progression of these symptoms in people without Down syndrome. Review question Do adults (18 years and older) with Down syndrome benefit from treatment with medicine to prevent cognitive decline, compared with other adults with Down syndrome who receive either fake medicine (placebos) or no medicine? Study characteristics In January 2015, we, a team of Cochrane researchers, searched for all medical studies that investigated the effect of any medicine or nutritional supplement on cognitive decline in adults with Down syndrome. We found nine relevant randomised controlled trials (this design produces the most reliable results) that we could include in this overview. These studies tested: ‐ donepezil, a medicine used to treat Alzheimer's disease (four studies); ‐ memantine, a medicine used to treat Alzheimer's disease (two studies); ‐ simvastatin, a (statin) medicine used to prevent heart disease (one study); ‐ a mixture of antioxidants, including forms of vitamins C and E, and alpha‐lipoic acid (one study); and ‐ acetyl‐L‐carnitine, a dietary supplement that has previously been used to treat dementia (one study). Five of the studies focused on adults aged 45 to 55 years and four focused on adults aged 20 to 29 years. Seven studies were conducted in either the USA or UK, one took place in Norway and the UK, and one study was conducted in Japan. Key results The nine studies we found examined the effects of five medicines that are, or have been, used to prevent cognitive decline. All the studies compared the medicine being tested with a placebo (a tablet or capsule that looked and tasted like the medicine, but which contained no medicine). Generally, those who received the medicine did no better than those who received the placebo in any of the areas assessed in the studies. The areas assessed included general functioning (including memory and thinking, speech, mood and behaviour); cognitive functioning (including memory, following what’s going on around you); adaptive behaviours (being able to do day‐to‐day tasks); or behaviour problems (such as being irritable or aggressive). The only medicine to show any positive effect was the statin, simvastatin. Preliminary findings from a very small study showed that simvastin had some benefit on improving memory compared to placebo. In the four donepezil studies, those participants given donepezil reported more headaches, dizziness, and nausea than participants given placebo. In the two memantine studies, there was no difference between participants given memantine or placebo for reports of headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Quality of the evidence Although the included studies were well conducted, most involved small numbers of participants and for many of the areas assessed we could not combine results from two or more studies. Overall, the quality of this evidence is low. We cannot be certain whether any of these medicines are effective. Running more trials with more people over a longer period of time would allow us answer this question with greater certainty. We could not find any trials that investigated many of the medicines used to prevent cognitive decline, and so research is needed to explore the effectiveness of these medications in the Down syndrome population.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background In the UK, dementia affects 5% of the population aged over 65 years and 25% of those over 85 years. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) represents one subtype and is thought to account for up to 16% of all degenerative dementias. Although the core of the diagnostic process in dementia rests firmly on clinical and cognitive assessments, a wide range of investigations are available to aid diagnosis. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) single‐photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is an established clinical tool that uses an intravenously injected radiolabelled tracer to map blood flow in the brain. In FTD the characteristic pattern seen is hypoperfusion of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes. This pattern of blood flow is different to patterns seen in other subtypes of dementia and so can be used to differentiate FTD. It has been proposed that a diagnosis of FTD, (particularly early stage), should be made not only on the basis of clinical criteria but using a combination of other diagnostic findings, including rCBF SPECT. However, more extensive testing comes at a financial cost, and with a potential risk to patient safety and comfort. Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of rCBF SPECT for diagnosing FTD in populations with suspected dementia in secondary/tertiary healthcare settings and in the differential diagnosis of FTD from other dementia subtypes. Search methods Our search strategy used two concepts: (a) the index test and (b) the condition of interest. We searched citation databases, including MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), BIOSIS (Ovid SP), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (Bireme), using structured search strategies appropriate for each database. In addition we searched specialised sources of diagnostic test accuracy studies and reviews including: MEDION (Universities of Maastricht and Leuven), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects) and HTA (Health Technology Assessment) database. We requested a search of the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies and used the related articles feature in PubMed to search for additional studies. We tracked key studies in citation databases such as Science Citation Index and Scopus to ascertain any further relevant studies. We identified ‘grey’ literature, mainly in the form of conference abstracts, through the Web of Science Core Collection, including Conference Proceedings Citation Index and Embase. The most recent search for this review was run on the 1 June 2013. Following title and abstract screening of the search results, full‐text papers were obtained for each potentially eligible study. These papers were then independently evaluated for inclusion or exclusion. Selection criteria We included both case‐control and cohort (delayed verification of diagnosis) studies. Where studies used a case‐control design we included all participants who had a clinical diagnosis of FTD or other dementia subtype using standard clinical diagnostic criteria. For cohort studies, we included studies where all participants with suspected dementia were administered rCBF SPECT at baseline. We excluded studies of participants from selected populations (e.g. post‐stroke) and studies of participants with a secondary cause of cognitive impairment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted information on study characteristics and data for the assessment of methodological quality and the investigation of heterogeneity. We assessed the methodological quality of each study using the QUADAS‐2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) tool. We produced a narrative summary describing numbers of studies that were found to have high/low/unclear risk of bias as well as concerns regarding applicability. To produce 2 x 2 tables, we dichotomised the rCBF SPECT results (scan positive or negative for FTD) and cross‐tabulated them against the results for the reference standard. These tables were then used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the index test. Meta‐analysis was not performed due to the considerable between‐study variation in clinical and methodological characteristics. Main results Eleven studies (1117 participants) met our inclusion criteria. These consisted of six case‐control studies, two retrospective cohort studies and three prospective cohort studies. Three studies used single‐headed camera SPECT while the remaining eight used multiple‐headed camera SPECT. Study design and methods varied widely. Overall, participant selection was not well described and the studies were judged as having either high or unclear risk of bias. Often the threshold used to define a positive SPECT result was not predefined and the results were reported with knowledge of the reference standard. Concerns regarding applicability of the studies to the review question were generally low across all three domains (participant selection, index test and reference standard). Sensitivities and specificities for differentiating FTD from non‐FTD ranged from 0.73 to 1.00 and from 0.80 to 1.00, respectively, for the three multiple‐headed camera studies. Sensitivities were lower for the two single‐headed camera studies; one reported a sensitivity and specificity of 0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.85) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.98), respectively, and the other a sensitivity and specificity of 0.36 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.50) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.95), respectively. Eight of the 11 studies which used SPECT to differentiate FTD from Alzheimer's disease used multiple‐headed camera SPECT. Of these studies, five used a case‐control design and reported sensitivities of between 0.52 and 1.00, and specificities of between 0.41 and 0.86. The remaining three studies used a cohort design and reported sensitivities of between 0.73 and 1.00, and specificities of between 0.94 and 1.00. The three studies that used single‐headed camera SPECT reported sensitivities of between 0.40 and 0.80, and specificities of between 0.61 and 0.97. Authors' conclusions At present, we would not recommend the routine use of rCBF SPECT in clinical practice because there is insufficient evidence from the available literature to support this. Further research into the use of rCBF SPECT for differentiating FTD from other dementias is required. In particular, protocols should be standardised, study populations should be well described, the threshold for 'abnormal' scans predefined and clear details given on how scans are analysed. More prospective cohort studies that verify the presence or absence of FTD during a period of follow up should be undertaken. Plain language summary Regional Cerebral Blood Flow SPECT for detection of Frontotemporal dementia in people with suspected dementia Background This review focused on one type of dementia, frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This neurodegenerative disease affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain and accounts for up to 16% of all degenerative dementias. People who have this disease may develop changes in their behaviour, speech or ability to plan. It is important to identify people with FTD correctly as the disease course and response to treatment differs from other dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease. One test used by healthcare professionals to help make a diagnosis of FTD, is regional cerebral blood flow single photon emission computed tomography (rCBF SPECT). This investigation allows visualisation of blood flow within the brain. In FTD it is thought that the pattern of blood flow to the brain can be used to tell the difference between FTD and other dementias. However, it is not clear whether using rCBF SPECT in this way improves our ability to make an accurate diagnosis of FTD. As all investigations come with a financial cost, it is important that their benefit is known. Aim:  This review assessed the evidence regarding the accuracy of rCBF SPECT in detecting FTD in people with suspected dementia. Study characteristics We searched many databases for all papers with FTD and rCBF SPECT as their focus. These papers were reviewed independently by several researchers. After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eleven studies including 299 individuals with FTD were available for this review. The studies were published over a 21‐year period, with a study size ranging from 27 to 363 participants, mainly recruited from University clinics, tertiary referral centres or memory clinics. Of the 11 studies, three used single‐headed (single detector) gamma cameras, a method no longer used in clinical practice today. Evidence is current to June 2013. Quality of the evidence The majority of studies were at high risk of bias due to insufficient details on how participants were selected and how the rCBF SPECT scans were conducted and analysed. The main limitations of the review were poor reporting, variability of study design and a lack of standardisation of image interpretation between centres. Key findings Due to small study numbers and large variation in how the studies were carried out, we are unable at present to recommend the routine use of rCBF SPECT for diagnosing FTD in clinical practice.},
